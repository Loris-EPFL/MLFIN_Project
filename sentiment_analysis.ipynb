Our owned brands include the global designer\\nlifestyle brands, Perry Ellis and Original Penguin by Munsingwear (\\\"Original Penguin\\\") as well as Ben\\nHogan , Cubavera , Farah , Grand Slam , Jantzen , Laundry by Shelli Segal , Rafaella and Savane . We license the Callaway Golf brand, PGA TOUR brand, and the Jack Nicklaus brand for golf apparel, the Jag brand\\nfor swimwear and cover-ups and the Nike brand for swimwear and accessories.\\n\\nWe have four reportable segments \\u2013 Men's Sportswear\\nand Swim, Women's Sportswear, Direct-to-Consumer, and Licensing \\u2013 and we have a strategically diversified global distribution network focused on leading department stores, company-operated retail stores, specialty stores and select\\nlicensing partners. We distribute our products primarily to wholesale customers that represent all major levels of retail distribution including department stores, national and regional chain stores, mass merchants, specialty stores, sporting goods\\nstores, the corporate wear market, e-commerce, as well as clubs and independent retailers, in North America and Europe. Our largest customers include Walmart Stores Inc., which includes Sam's Wholesale Club (\\\"Sam's\\\") together\\n(\\\"Walmart\\\"), The Marmaxx Group, and Macy's, Inc. (\\\"Macy's\\\").\\n\\nWe also distribute through our own retail\\nstores. As of April 1, 2016, we operated 41 Perry Ellis, 12 Original Penguin and two multi-brand retail outlet stores located primarily in upscale retail outlet malls across the United\\n\\n31\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nStates, United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. As of April 1, 2016 we also operated three Perry Ellis, two Cubavera, 16 Original Penguin and one multi-brand full price retail stores located in\\nupscale demographic markets in the United States and United Kingdom. In addition, we leverage our design, sourcing and logistics expertise by offering a limited number of private label programs to retailers.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2016, our Men's Sportswear and Swim segment, which is comprised of men's sportswear, swimwear and accessories, accounted\\nfor 71% of our total revenues, our Women's Sportswear segment accounted for 14% of our total revenues, our Direct-to-Consumer segment, which is comprised of retail and e-commerce, accounted for 11% of our total revenues and our licensing\\nsegment accounted for approximately 4% of our total revenues. Finally, our U.S. based business represented approximately 87% of total revenues, while our foreign operations represented 13% of total revenues for fiscal 2016.\\n\\nThe revenue generated through our licensing business, which we license to third parties for certain production, sales and/or distribution\\nrights through geographic licensing arrangements is a significant contributor to our operating income and our arrangements heighten the overall awareness of our brands without requiring us to make capital investments or incur additional operating\\nexpenses. As of Fiscal 2016, we licensed our brands through four worldwide, 71 domestic and 91 international license agreements covering over 100 countries.\\n\\nOur products have historically been geared towards lighter weight apparel generally worn during the spring and summer months. We believe that\\nthis seasonality has been reduced with the strengthening of our fall, winter, and holiday merchandise. Our swimwear business, however, is highly seasonal in nature, with the significant majority of our sales occurring in our first and fourth\\nquarters. Seasonality can be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of advance and fill-in orders, the amount of sales to different distribution channels, and overall product mix among traditional merchandise, fashion merchandise and\\nswimwear. Our higher-priced products generally tend to be less sensitive to economic and weather conditions. Revenues for our second quarter will typically be lower than our other quarters due to the impact of seasonal sales.\\n\\nWe believe that our future growth will come as a result of organic growth from our continued emphasis on our existing brands; new and expanded\\nproduct lines; domestic and international licensing opportunities; international, direct retail and e-commerce opportunities and selective acquisitions and opportunities that fit strategically with our business model. Our future results may be\\nimpacted by risks and trends set forth in \\\"Item 1A. Risk Factors\\\" and elsewhere in this report.\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nSee Footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in \\\"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" for recent accounting\\npronouncements.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\n\\nIncluded in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this report is a summary of all significant accounting policies used in\\nthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We follow the accounting methods and practices as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\\"GAAP\\\"). In particular, our critical\\naccounting policies and areas in which we use judgment are revenue recognition, the estimated collectability of accounts receivable, the recoverability of obsolete or overstocked inventory, the impairment of assets that are our trademarks and\\ngoodwill, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the measurement of retirement related benefits.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition. Sales\\nare recognized at the time legal title to the product passes to the customer, generally FOB Perry Ellis' distribution facilities, net of trade allowances, discounts, estimated returns and other allowances, considering historical and anticipated\\ntrends. Revenues are recorded net of corresponding sales taxes. Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns and corresponding sales tax at the time of sale to consumers. Royalty income is recognized when earned on the basis of the\\nterms specified in the underlying contractual agreements.\\n\\nAccounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts\\nreceivable and an allowance for estimated trade discounts, co-op advertising, allowances provided to retail customers to flow goods through the\\n\\n32\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nretail channel, and losses resulting from the inability of our retail customers to make required payments considering historical and anticipated trends. Management reviews these allowances and\\nconsiders the aging of account balances, historical experience, changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic and product trends, customer payment activity and other relevant factors. A small portion of our accounts receivable are\\ninsured for collections. Should any of these factors change, the estimates made by management may also change, which could affect the level of future provisions.\\n\\nInventories. Our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Estimates and judgment are required in determining what\\nitems to stock and at what levels, and what items to discontinue and how to value them. We evaluate all of our inventory style-size-color stock keeping units, or SKUs, to determine excess or slow-moving SKUs based on orders on hand and\\nprojections of future demand and market conditions. For those units in inventory that are so identified, we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends. If the projected net sales value is less than cost, on an\\nindividual SKU basis, we write down inventory to reflect the lower value. This methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold.\\n\\nIntangible Assets . We review our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairments at least annually and perform\\nimpairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year by among other things, obtaining independent third party valuations. We evaluate the \\\"fair value\\\" of our identifiable intangible assets for purposes of recognition and measurement\\nof impairment losses. Evaluating indefinite useful life assets for impairment involves certain judgments and estimates, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, our strategic plans with regard to our\\noperations, historical and anticipated performance of our operations and other factors. If we incorrectly anticipate these trends or unexpected events occur, our results of operations could be materially affected. We estimate the fair value of the\\ntrademarks based on the application of (1) the relief from royalty method for our wholesale business and (2) the yield capitalization method for our licensing business. The combination of these two values represents the total value of each of the\\ntrademarks to the Company. The cash flow models we use to estimate the fair values of our trademarks involve several assumptions. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates. Assumptions critical to the fair value\\nestimates are: (i) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the trademarks; (ii) royalty rates used in the trademark valuations; (iii) projected revenue and expense growth rates; and (iv)\\nprojected long-term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values. These and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and could change in the future based on period-specific facts and\\ncircumstances. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\\n\\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets\\nof businesses acquired and accounted for under the acquisition method. We review goodwill at least annually for possible impairment during the fourth quarter of each year using a discounted cash flow analysis that requires that certain assumptions\\nand estimates be made regarding industry economic factors and future profitability and cash flows. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves certain judgments and estimates, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market\\nvaluations, our strategic plans with regard to our operations, historical and anticipated performance of our operations and other factors. If we incorrectly anticipate these trends or unexpected events occur, our results of operations could be\\nmaterially affected. Assumptions critical to the fair value estimates are: (i) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of each reporting unit; (ii) projected revenue and expense growth rates; and\\n(iii) projected long-term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values. Adverse changes in these assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates and result in additional goodwill impairments. The goodwill impairment test\\nis a two-step process that requires us to make decisions in determining appropriate assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the\\ncarrying values, which include the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment, if any, by determining an \\\"implied fair value\\\" of\\ngoodwill. The determination of each reporting unit's implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair\\nvalue of goodwill, which is compared to its corresponding carrying amount.\\n\\n33\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nDeferred Taxes . We account for income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax\\nassets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is assessed based upon all\\navailable positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is recorded, if\\nrequired, to reduce deferred tax assets to the portion that is expected to more likely than not be realized.\\n\\nThe ultimate realization of\\nthe deferred tax assets, related to net operating losses, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to their expiration. If our estimates and assumptions about future taxable income are not appropriate, the\\nvalue of our deferred tax asset may not be recoverable, and may result in an increase to our valuation allowance that will impact current earnings.\\n\\nIt is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management's assessment of\\nwhether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. To the extent that we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess\\nof the liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\\n\\nIn addition to judgments associated with\\nvaluation accounts, our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions. Because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates, the shift in mix\\nduring a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change.\\n\\nRetirement-Related Benefits . The pension obligations\\nrelated to our defined benefit pension plans are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including the discount rate, expected return of plan assets, future compensation increases, and other factors,\\nwhich are updated on an annual basis. Management is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over\\nfuture periods, and therefore, generally affect the recognized pension expense or benefit and our pension obligation in future periods. The fair value of plan assets is based on the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity\\nmarkets. Therefore, the market value of the plan assets can change dramatically in a relatively short period of time. Additionally, the measurement of the plan's benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. As a result,\\nif the equity market declines and/or interest rates decrease, the plan's estimated accumulated benefit obligation could exceed the fair value of the plan assets and therefore, we would be required to establish an additional minimum liability,\\nwhich would result in a reduction in shareholders' equity for the amount of the shortfall.\\n\\n34\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nOur Results of Operations for Fiscal 2016\\n\\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated selected items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage\\nof total revenues:\\n\\nFiscal Years Ended\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2016\\n\\nJanuary 31, 2015\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2014\\n\\nNet sales\\n\\n96.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n96.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n96.7\\n\\n%\\n\\nRoyalty income\\n\\n3.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.6\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n%\\n\\nTotal revenues\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\nCost of sales\\n\\n64.5\\n\\n%\\n\\n66.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n66.8\\n\\n%\\n\\nGross profit\\n\\n35.5\\n\\n%\\n\\n34.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n33.2\\n\\n%\\n\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n\\n30.7\\n\\n%\\n\\n30.2\\n\\n%\\n\\n29.9\\n\\n%\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n%\\n\\nImpairment on long-lived assets\\n\\n2.3\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.8\\n\\n%\\n\\nImpairment of goodwill\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n%\\n\\nGain on sale of long-lived assets\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n%\\n\\nOperating income (loss)\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n%\\n\\n-2.1\\n\\n%\\n\\nCosts on early extinguishment of debt\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n%\\n\\nInterest expense\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.7\\n\\n%\\n\\nNet (loss) income before income taxes\\n\\n-0.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n-3.8\\n\\n%\\n\\nIncome tax (benefit) provision\\n\\n-0.05\\n\\n%\\n\\n5.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n-1.3\\n\\n%\\n\\nNet (loss)\\n\\n-0.8\\n\\n%\\n\\n-4.2\\n\\n%\\n\\n-2.5\\n\\n%\\n\\n35\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, selected financial data expressed by\\nsegments and includes a reconciliation of EBITDA to operating income by segment, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2016\\n\\nJanuary 31, 2015\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2014\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nRevenues by segment:\\n\\nMen's Sportswear and Swim\\n\\n$\\n\\n640,600\\n\\n$\\n\\n635,182\\n\\n$\\n\\n664,824\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear\\n\\n127,692\\n\\n130,852\\n\\n135,994\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer\\n\\n96,514\\n\\n92,203\\n\\n81,755\\n\\nLicensing\\n\\n34,709\\n\\n31,735\\n\\n29,651\\n\\nTotal revenues\\n\\n$\\n\\n899,515\\n\\n$\\n\\n889,972\\n\\n$\\n\\n912,224\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2016\\n\\nJanuary 31, 2015\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2014\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nReconciliation of operating income to EBITDA\\n\\nOperating income (loss) by segment:\\n\\nMen's Sportswear and Swim\\n\\n$\\n\\n20,068\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,847\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,975\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear\\n\\n(9,248\\n\\n)\\n\\n859\\n\\n(10,883\\n\\n)\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer\\n\\n(11,805\\n\\n)\\n\\n(6,675\\n\\n)\\n\\n(12,306\\n\\n)\\n\\nLicensing\\n\\n7,649\\n\\n24,877\\n\\n(5,155\\n\\n)\\n\\nTotal operating income (loss)\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,664\\n\\n$\\n\\n22,908\\n\\n$\\n\\n(19,369\\n\\n)\\n\\nAdd:\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n\\nMen's Sportswear and Swim\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,375\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,627\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,043\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear\\n\\n2,250\\n\\n1,903\\n\\n1,899\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer\\n\\n3,884\\n\\n3,519\\n\\n3,549\\n\\nLicensing\\n\\n184\\n\\n149\\n\\n135\\n\\nTotal depreciation and amortization\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,693\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,198\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,626\\n\\nEBITDA by segment:\\n\\nMen's Sportswear and Swim\\n\\n$\\n\\n27,443\\n\\n$\\n\\n10,474\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,018\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear\\n\\n(6,998\\n\\n)\\n\\n2,762\\n\\n(8,984\\n\\n)\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer\\n\\n(7,921\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3,156\\n\\n)\\n\\n(8,757\\n\\n)\\n\\nLicensing\\n\\n7,833\\n\\n25,026\\n\\n(5,020\\n\\n)\\n\\nTotal EBITDA\\n\\n$\\n\\n20,357\\n\\n$\\n\\n35,106\\n\\n$\\n\\n(6,743\\n\\n)\\n\\nEBITDA margin by segment\\n\\nMen's Sportswear and Swim\\n\\n4.3\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.4\\n\\n%\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear\\n\\n(5.5\\n\\n%)\\n\\n2.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n(6.6\\n\\n%)\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer\\n\\n(8.2\\n\\n%)\\n\\n(3.4\\n\\n%)\\n\\n(10.7\\n\\n%)\\n\\nLicensing\\n\\n22.6\\n\\n%\\n\\n78.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n(16.9\\n\\n%)\\n\\nTotal EBITDA margin\\n\\n2.3\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n(0.7\\n\\n%)\\n\\nEBITDA consists of earnings before interest, cost on early extinguishment of debt, depreciation and\\namortization, and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and does not represent cash flow from operations. The most directly comparable\\nGAAP financial measure, presented above, is operating income by segment. EBITDA and EBITDA margin by segment are presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that they are a common measure of operating performance in the\\napparel industry.\\n\\nThe following is a discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (\\\"fiscal\\n2016\\\") as compared with the fiscal year ended fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 (\\\"fiscal 2015\\\") and fiscal 2015 as compared with the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014 (\\\"fiscal 2014\\\").\\n\\nOur fiscal 2016 results as compared to our fiscal 2015 results\\n\\nNet sales . Men's Sportswear and Swim net sales in fiscal 2016 were $640.6 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 0.9%, from\\n$635.2 million in fiscal 2015. The net sales increase was attributed primarily to increases in the Perry Ellis and Original Penguin collections and golf lifestyle apparel, partially offset by decreases in our mid-tier sportswear as we reduced\\npenetration of our exclusive branded products.\\n\\n36\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear net sales in fiscal 2016 were $127.7 million, a decrease of $3.2 million,\\nor 2.4%, from $130.9 million in fiscal 2015. The net sales decrease was primarily due to the sale of C&C California in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The net sales decrease was partially offset by increases in our contemporary Laundry by\\nShelli Segal dresses and Rafaella sportswear, driven by solid performance at retail.\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer net sales in fiscal 2016 were\\n$96.5 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 4.7%, from $92.2 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was driven by e-commerce, which posted a 27.2% increase in comparable sales, while retail comparable same store sales were even.\\n\\nRoyalty income . Royalty income for fiscal 2016 was $34.7 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 9.5%, from $31.7 million in fiscal\\n2015. Royalty income increases were attributed to increases in our Perry Ellis and Original Penguin businesses as well as 26 new licenses signed during fiscal 2016. Approximately 88.0% of our royalty income was attributed to guaranteed minimum\\nroyalties with the balance attributable to royalty income in excess of guaranteed minimums for fiscal 2016.\\n\\nGross profit. Gross\\nprofit was $319.1 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $16.1 million, or 5.3%, as compared to $303.0 million in fiscal 2015. This increase is attributed to the sales mix composition described above and the factors described within the gross profit\\nmargin section below.\\n\\nGross profit margin. In fiscal 2016, gross profit margins were 35.5% as a percentage of total\\nrevenue as compared to 34.0% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 150 basis points. This increase was primarily associated with expansion across our licensing and core domestic collections; partially offset by the exit of the Elite component of our Nike\\nlicensed business, the inventory liquidation of divested C&C California, as well as the consolidation of our foreign sourcing offices. Gross margin was also positively impacted by reduced markdowns and favorable merchandising margins in domestic\\nbusinesses as well as a favorable mix driven by higher margin in direct-to-consumer and licensing businesses.\\n\\nSelling, general and\\nadministrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 were $275.9 million, an increase of $7.1 million, or 2.6%, from $268.8 million in fiscal 2015. The increase reflects $4.4 million in fiscal 2016 related to\\npension costs on lump sum settlement payments on the termination of the defined benefit plan that we expect to complete during fiscal 2017. In addition, increases were realized related to the activist campaign, consolidation of our N.Y. corporate\\noffice space and sourcing office, as well as incentive plan accruals and investments in international business. These increases were partially offset by cost savings initiatives implemented during fiscal 2015 which included tighter expense control\\nacross our infrastructure.\\n\\nEBITDA. Men's Sportswear and Swim EBITDA margin in fiscal 2016 increased 270 basis points to 4.3%,\\nfrom 1.6% in fiscal 2015. The EBITDA margin increase was driven principally by the expansion in gross margin in our Perry Ellis and Original Penguin collection businesses. We also realized favorable leverage in selling, general and administrative\\nexpenses, most notably in employee related expenses, which was partially offset by the planned increased infrastructure expenditures in this segment, as well as exit costs associated with the Elite component of our licensed Nike business.\\nAdditionally the segment benefited from the gain on the sale of the Beijing building as discussed below.\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear EBITDA\\nmargin in fiscal 2016 decreased 760 basis points to (5.5%), from 2.1% in fiscal 2015. The EBITDA margin was unfavorably impacted by exit costs associated with C&C California. The margin was also negatively impacted by the impairment of goodwill,\\nwhich is further discussed below. The decrease was partially offset by the expansion in the Rafaella collection business coupled with favorable leverage in selling, general and administrative expenses, most notably in employee expenses and other\\noverhead.\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer EBITDA margin in fiscal 2016 decreased 480 basis points to (8.2%), from (3.4%) in fiscal 2015. The decrease\\nwas primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs attributable to renewal of leases coupled with additional costs associated with freight and professional fees. The margin was further impacted negatively by the impairment of certain leasehold\\nimprovements, which is further discussed below.\\n\\n37\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nLicensing EBITDA margin in fiscal 2016 decreased to 22.6%, from 78.9% in fiscal 2015. In fiscal\\n2016, an impairment of $18.2 million on long-lived assets was recognized. No such impairment was recognized during fiscal 2015, thus the large decrease in EBITDA margin. Additionally, we realized a loss on the sale of the C&C California\\nbrand, while in fiscal 2015 we realized a gain from the sale of the Jantzen rights as described below. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in royalty income.\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2016 was $13.7 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 12.3%,\\nfrom $12.2 million in fiscal 2015. The increase is attributed to depreciation related to our capital expenditures and leaseholds, primarily in the men's sportswear and swim segment, as well as the direct-to-consumer segment. For fiscal 2016 we\\nhad capital expenditures of $17.2 million as compared to capital expenditures of $16.9 million in fiscal 2015.\\n\\nImpairment on assets\\nand goodwill . As a result of our annual impairment analysis, during fiscal 2016, we recorded trademark and goodwill impairment charges of $18.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively, due to decreases in our projected revenues principally\\nresulting from our internal review of brands and businesses that will be afforded a reduced focus in our forward strategy. This is a positive step as we streamline our business/brand model. Some of the impairments resulted from a decline in the\\nfuture anticipated cash flows from these trademarks, which was due, in part, to the current economic challenges and market conditions in the apparel industry. There was no such impairment for fiscal 2015. In addition, we recorded a $2.4 million\\nimpairment charge to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets (primarily leaseholds in our direct-to-consumer segment) to their estimated fair value.\\n\\nGain (Loss) on sale of long-lived assets . During fiscal 2016, we entered into a sales agreement, in the amount of $8.2 million,\\nfor the sale of our sourcing office building located in Beijing, China. As a result of this transaction we recorded a gain in the amount of $4.5 million. Also during fiscal 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the intellectual property of our\\nC&C California brand to a third party. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a loss of ($0.7) million in the licensing segment.\\n\\nDuring fiscal 2015, we entered into a sales agreement, in the amount of $1.3 million, for the sale of Australian, Fiji and New Zealand\\ntrademark rights with respect to Jantzen. Payments on the purchase price are due in five installments of $250,000 over a five year period. Interest on the purchase price that remains unpaid will accrue at a rate of 3.5% per annum calculated on an\\nannual basis. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of $0.9 million in the licensing segment.\\n\\nCost on early\\nextinguishment of debt . On April 6, 2015, we called for the partial redemption of $100 million of our $150 million outstanding 7 7 \\u2044 8 %\\nSenior Subordinated Notes. The redemption terms provided for the payment of a redemption premium of 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed. On May 6, 2015, we completed the redemption of $100 million of our senior subordinated notes. We\\nincurred debt extinguishment costs of approximately $5.1 million in connection with the redemption premium and the write-off of note issuance costs.\\n\\nInterest expense . Interest expense in 2016 was $9.3 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 35.0%, from $14.3 million in fiscal 2015.\\nThe decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest resulting from the partial redemption of $100 million of our senior subordinated notes. This decrease was partially offset by a higher average amount borrowed on our credit facility\\nas compared to the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in the credit facility was due to its use for the redemption of the notes as discussed above.\\n\\nIncome taxes. Our income tax (benefit) provision in fiscal 2016 was ($0.4) million, a $46.2 million decrease as compared to $45.8\\nmillion in 2015. For fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate was 5.6% as compared to 531.4% for 2015. The decrease in the tax rate is primarily attributed to the establishment of the valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets which\\noccurred during fiscal 2015. See Footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in \\\"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" for further details regarding taxable income by jurisdiction.\\n\\nNet loss. Our net loss in fiscal 2016 was ($7.3) million, a reduction in loss of $29.9 million in income, or 80.4%, as compared to a\\nnet loss of ($37.2) million in fiscal 2015. The changes in operating results were due to the items described above.\\n\\n38\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nOur fiscal 2015 results as compared to our fiscal 2014 results\\n\\nNet sales . Men's Sportswear and Swim net sales in fiscal 2015 were $635.2 million, a decrease of $29.6 million, or 4.5%, from\\n$664.8 million in fiscal 2014. The net sales decrease was attributed primarily to the exit of $20 million in certain private and retailer exclusive branded programs and planned reductions in Perry Ellis domestically. Additionally, the impact of the\\nWest Coast port congestion and lockdown impacted our fourth quarter significantly. We had $18 million in missed shipments due to this issue at fiscal year-end. These decreases were partially offset by increases across our golf sportswear brands,\\nOriginal Penguin and Nike swim.\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear net sales in fiscal 2015 were $130.9 million, a decrease of $5.1 million, or\\n3.8%, from $136.0 million in fiscal 2014. The segment was negatively impacted by $5 million of the missed West Coast port shipments. Despite this, we refined distribution to focus on full price specialty and department stores and reduced\\nprograms to the special markets channel and have begun to see market share gains in our products.\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer net sales in fiscal\\n2015 were $92.2 million, an increase of $10.4 million, or 12.7%, from $81.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by a 3.2% comparable same store sales improvement driven by Perry Ellis, as well as by our direct e-commerce sales, which\\nposted a 34.1% sales increase over the comparable period last year.\\n\\nRoyalty income . Royalty income for fiscal 2015 was $31.7\\nmillion, an increase of $2.0 million, or 6.7%, from $29.7 million in fiscal 2014. Royalty income increases were attributed to increases in the Perry Ellis, Original Penguin and Laundry brands, as well as, 27 new licensing agreements executed\\nduring the period. Approximately 82.6% of our royalty income was attributed to guaranteed minimum royalties with the balance attributable to royalty income in excess of guaranteed minimums for fiscal 2015.\\n\\nGross profit. Gross profit was $303.0 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.1%, as compared to $302.8 million in\\nfiscal 2014. Despite our net sales decrease, gross profit is essentially even as compared to prior year, due to the factors described below regarding our margin expansion during fiscal 2015 and our expansion in royalty income as described above.\\n\\nGross profit margin. In fiscal 2015, gross profit margins were 34.0% as a percentage of total revenue as compared to\\n33.2% in fiscal 2014, an increase of 80 basis points. The increase was primarily attributed to a reduction in promotional activity in the sportswear collection businesses, a more favorable revenue mix between branded and private label revenues, as\\nwell as, a stronger contribution from our higher margin international platform and licensing revenues. Direct-to-consumer segment also realized fewer promotions across all venues. These margin improvements were partially offset by liquidation of\\nexited programs in golf and sportswear.\\n\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses\\nin fiscal 2015 were $268.8 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 1.4%, from $272.7 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease is primarily attributed to a $9 million reduction associated with our infrastructure review, which was partially offset by $3\\nmillion in investments in our international growth strategy, which included the launch of our golf business in Europe. We also experienced a $1.8 million unfavorable foreign exchange loss principally driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar against\\nglobal currencies.\\n\\nEBITDA. Men's Sportswear and Swim EBITDA margin in fiscal 2015 decreased 80 basis points to 1.6%, from\\n2.4% in fiscal 2014. The EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by the reduced leverage due to the decrease in net sales described above. The EBITDA margin was favorably impacted from cost savings as a result of our infrastructure review, as well as,\\nfavorable gross margin expansion driven by the mix of revenue in our international business coupled with increased margins in our Perry Ellis and Original Penguin sportswear collections. During fiscal 2014, the margin was negatively impacted by\\ncosts associated with our relocation of our New York offices.\\n\\nWomen's Sportswear EBITDA margin in fiscal 2015 increased 870 basis\\npoints to 2.1%, from (6.6%) in fiscal 2014. The EBITDA margin was positively impacted by the increase in gross margin experienced in Rafaella sportswear, partially offset by the negative impact of the reduced leverage from the decrease in net sales\\ndescribed above. Additionally, during fiscal 2014, the margin was negatively impacted by costs associated with the relocation of our New York offices.\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer EBITDA margin in fiscal 2015 increased 730 basis points to (3.4%), from (10.7%) in fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily\\nattributable to the increase in revenue from our stores and e-commerce\\n\\n39\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nbusiness, as described above. The increase in revenue resulted in a favorable leverage in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, we consolidated our businesses under one\\noperational team thereby reducing overhead. EBITDA margin also benefited from the expansion in gross profit margins discussed above.\\n\\nLicensing EBITDA margin in fiscal 2015 increased to 78.9%, from (16.9%) in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, an impairment of $34.3 million on\\nlong-lived assets was recognized. No such impairment was recognized during fiscal 2015, thus the large increase in EBITDA margin. Additionally, other increases were attributed to the increase in royalty income from the 27 new licensing agreements.\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2015 was $12.2 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or\\n3.2%, from $12.6 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease is attributed to assets becoming fully depreciated and fewer capital expenditures during the current year. For fiscal 2015 we had capital expenditures of $16.9 million as compared to capital\\nexpenditures of $22.2 million in fiscal 2014.\\n\\nGain on sale of long-lived assets . During fiscal 2015, we entered into a sales\\nagreement, in the amount of $1.3 million, for the sale of Australian, Fiji and New Zealand trademark rights with respect to Jantzen. Payments on the purchase price are due in five installments of $250,000 over a five year period. Interest on the\\npurchase price that remains unpaid will accrue at a rate of 3.5% per annum calculated on an annual basis. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of $0.9 million in the licensing segment.\\n\\nDuring fiscal 2013, we entered into a sales agreement, in the amount of $7.5 million, for certain Asian trademark rights with respect our John\\nHenry brand. The transaction closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of $6.3 million. This gain was included in our licensing segment's operating income. The gain of $6.3 million was\\npartially offset by the ($0.1) million loss related to the sale of our Winnsboro distribution facility during the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\\n\\nInterest expense . Interest expense in 2015 was $14.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 4.7%, from $15.0 million in fiscal\\n2014. The primary reason for the decrease is related to the savings generated from the refinancing of our mortgage loans in the second half of fiscal 2014, as well as lower average borrowings on our credit facility as compared to our borrowings\\nin the prior year.\\n\\nIncome taxes. Our income tax (benefit) provision in fiscal 2015 was $45.8 million, a $57.4 million increase as\\ncompared to ($11.6) million in 2014. For fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate was 531.4% as compared to 33.8% for 2014. The fiscal 2015 provision was impacted by a charge of $42.4 million due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on our\\ndomestic differed tax assets. The West Coast port congestion and our cumulative losses under Accounting Standards Codification 740 resulted in the non-cash valuation reserve being required. The position does not impact the Company's ability to\\nuse its deferred tax assets in the future. See Footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in \\\"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" for further details regarding taxable income by jurisdiction.\\n\\nNet loss. Our net loss in fiscal 2015 was ($37.2) million, an increase of $14.4 million, or 63.2%, as compared to net loss of ($22.8)\\nmillion in fiscal 2014. The changes in operating results were due to the items described above.\\n\\nOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nWe rely principally on cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility to finance our operations, pension funding\\nrequirements, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. We believe that our working capital requirements will increase for next year as we continue to expand internationally. As of January 30, 2016, our total working capital was $218.8 million as\\ncompared to $240.2 million as of January 31, 2015. We believe that our cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility and remaining letter of credit facilities are sufficient to meet our working capital needs and\\ncapital expenditure needs over the next year.\\n\\nWe consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 30, 2016,\\nto be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. As of January 30, 2016, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $31.1 million. We have not, nor do\\nwe anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\\n\\n40\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $30.2 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to cash\\nprovided by operating activities of $55.1 million in fiscal 2015 and cash provided by operating activities of $0.2 million in fiscal 2014.\\n\\nAlthough in fiscal 2016 we had a net loss, the loss was primarily attributed to non-cash charges of $26.6 million for impairments, $14.3\\nmillion for depreciation and amortization, and $4.4 million for the pension settlement charge. When added back to the net loss, we generated $38.0 million in cash from operations. Further sources of increases in cash from operations were a decrease\\nin accounts receivable of $3.1 million and a decrease of prepaid income taxes of $4.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $10.3 million, a decrease in deferred pension obligation\\nof $1.1 million, a decrease in accrued interest payable of $2.5 million and a slight increase in inventories of $1.2 million. Our inventory turnover ratio increased to 3.7 as compared to 3.4 for fiscal 2015 resulting from tighter inventory\\nmanagement.\\n\\nThe cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in inventory of $20.1\\nmillion, a decrease in accounts receivable of $6.5 million, a decrease of prepaid income taxes of $1.1 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.2 million; partially offset by a decrease in deferred pension obligation of\\n$3.6 million. Our inventory turnover ratio remained flat at 3.4 as compared to fiscal 2014. While the inventory turnover ratio remained flat, inventory levels declined as noted above resulting from tighter inventory management.\\n\\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.0 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to cash used by investing activities of $21.1 million\\nin fiscal 2015. The net cash provided during fiscal 2016, primarily reflects proceeds from investment maturities of $22.2 million, the proceeds from the sale of C&C California in the amount of $2.5 million, the proceeds from notes receivable\\nassociated with the sale of Australian, Fiji and New Zealand Jantzen trademark rights in the amount of $0.3 million and the proceeds from the sale of the Beijing building of $8.2 million offset by related expenses for the sale of $1.9 million.\\nFurther reductions include the purchase of property and equipment of $16.2 million, primarily for new leaseholds, and the purchase of investments in the amount of $12.1 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately\\n$15 million.\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $21.1 million in fiscal 2015, as compared to cash used by investing activities of\\n$27.4 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash used during fiscal 2015, primarily reflects the purchase of property and equipment of $16.7 million, primarily for new leaseholds, and the purchase of investments in the amount of $31.5 million; partially\\noffset by proceeds from investment maturities of $26.6 million and the proceeds from notes receivable associated with the sale of Australian, Fiji and New Zealand Jantzen trademark rights in the amount of $0.3 million.\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities was $45.4 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $17.8 million in\\nfiscal 2015. The net cash used during fiscal 2016 primarily reflects payments for the partial redemption on our senior subordinated notes of $100 million, purchases of treasury stock of $7.0 million, payments of deferred financing fees on the senior\\ncredit facility of $0.6 million, payments on real estate mortgages of $0.8 million, and payments on capital leases of $0.3 million; partially offset by net borrowings on our senior credit facility of $61.8 million and proceeds from exercises of\\nstock options of $1.4 million.\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities was $17.8 million in fiscal 2015, as compared to cash used in\\nfinancing activities of $0.6 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash used during fiscal 2015 primarily reflects net payments on our senior credit facility of $8.2 million, purchases of treasury stock of $8.8 million, payments on real estate mortgages\\nof $0.8 million, and payments on capital leases of $0.3 million; partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.4 million.\\n\\nOur Board of Directors has authorized us to purchase, from time to time and as market and business conditions warrant, up to $70 million of\\nour common stock for cash in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions through October 31, 2016. Although our Board of Directors allocated a maximum of $70 million to carry out the program, we are not obligated to purchase any\\nspecific number of outstanding shares and will reevaluate the program on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nDuring fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we\\nrepurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $7.0 million, $8.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively. There were no shares outstanding as of January 30, 2016 and as of January 31, 2015, there were 770,753 shares of treasury stock\\noutstanding at a cost of approximately $15.7 million.\\n\\n41\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nDuring fiscal 2016, we retired shares of treasury stock recorded at a cost of approximately $22.7\\nmillion. Accordingly, during fiscal 2016, we reduced common stock and additional paid in capital by $11,000 and $22.7 million, respectively.\\n\\n7 7 \\u2044 8 % $150 Million Senior Subordinated Notes Payable\\n\\nIn March 2011, we issued $150 million\\n7 7 \\u2044 8 % senior subordinated notes, due April 1, 2019. The proceeds of this offering were used to retire the $150 million 8 7 \\u2044 8 % senior subordinated notes due September 15, 2013 and to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on the senior credit facility. The proceeds to us were\\n$146.5 million yielding an effective interest rate of 8.0%.\\n\\nOn April 6, 2015, we elected to call for the partial redemption of $100\\nmillion of our $150 million 7 7 / 8 % senior subordinated notes due 2019 and a notice of redemption was sent to all registered holders of the senior subordinated notes. The redemption terms provided for the payment of a\\nredemption premium of 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed. On May 6, 2015, we completed the redemption of the $100 million of our senior subordinated notes. We incurred debt extinguishment costs of approximately $5.1 million in connection\\nwith the redemption, including the redemption premium as well as the write-off of note issuance costs.\\n\\nCertain Covenants. The\\nindenture governing the senior subordinated notes contains certain covenants which restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness in certain circumstances, pay dividends or make other\\ndistributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock, make investments or other restricted payments, create liens on assets to secure debt, engage in transactions with affiliates, and effect a consolidation or merger. We are not aware of any\\nnon-compliance with any of our covenants in this indenture. We could be materially harmed if we violate any covenants because the indenture's trustee could declare the outstanding notes, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and\\npayable, which we may not be able to satisfy. In addition, a violation could also constitute a cross-default under the senior credit facility, the letter of credit facilities and the real estate mortgages resulting in all of our debt obligations\\nbecoming immediately due and payable, which we may not be able to satisfy.\\n\\nSenior Credit Facility\\n\\nOn April 22, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior credit facility (the \\\"Credit Facility\\\"), with Wells Fargo Bank,\\nNational Association, as agent for the lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent. The Credit Facility provides a revolving credit facility of up to an aggregate amount of $200 million. The Credit Facility has been extended through\\nApril 30, 2020 (\\\"Maturity Date\\\"). In connection with this amendment and restatement, we paid fees in the amount of $0.6 million. These fees will be amortized over the term of the Credit Facility as interest expense. At January 30, 2016, we\\nhad outstanding borrowings of $61.8 million under the Credit Facility. At January 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\\n\\nCertain Covenants . The Credit Facility contains certain financial and other covenants, which, among other things, require the Company\\nto maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if availability falls below certain thresholds. We are not aware of any non-compliance with any of our covenants in this Credit Facility. These covenants may restrict our ability and the ability of\\nour subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and liens in certain circumstances, redeem or repurchase capital stock, make certain investments or sell assets. We may pay cash dividends subject to certain restrictions set\\nforth in the covenants including, but not limited to, meeting a minimum excess availability threshold and no occurrence of a default. We could be materially harmed if we violate any covenants, as the lenders under the Credit Facility could declare\\nall amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors. In\\naddition, a covenant violation that is not cured or waived by the lenders could also constitute a cross-default under certain of our other outstanding indebtedness, such as the indenture relating to our 7 7 / 8 % senior\\nsubordinated notes due April 1, 2019, our letter of credit facilities, or our real estate mortgage loans. A cross-default could result in all of our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, which we may not be able to satisfy.\\nAdditionally, our Credit Facility includes a subjective acceleration clause if a \\\"material adverse change\\\" in our business occurs. We believe that the likelihood of the lender exercising this right is remote .\\n\\n42\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nBorrowing Base. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are limited to a borrowing base\\ncalculation, which generally restricts the outstanding balance to the sum of (a) 87.5% of eligible receivables plus (b) 87.5% of eligible foreign accounts up to $1.5 million plus (c) the lesser of (i) the inventory loan limit, which equals 80% of\\nthe maximum credit under the Credit Facility at the time, (ii) a maximum of 70.0% of eligible finished goods inventory with an inventory limit not to exceed $125 million, or 90.0% of the net recovery percentage (as defined in the Credit Facility) of\\neligible inventory.\\n\\nInterest. Interest on the outstanding principal balance drawn under the Credit Facility accrues at the prime\\nrate and at the rate quoted by the agent for Eurodollar loans. The margin adjusts quarterly, in a range of 0.50% to 1.00% for prime rate loans and 1.50% to 2.00% for Eurodollar loans, based on the previous quarterly average of excess availability\\nplus excess cash on the last day of the previous quarter.\\n\\nSecurity . As security for the indebtedness under the Credit Facility, we\\ngranted to the lenders a first priority security interest (subject to liens permitted under the Credit Facility to be senior thereto) in substantially all of our existing and future assets, including, without limitation, accounts receivable,\\ninventory, deposit accounts, general intangibles, equipment and capital stock or membership interests, as the case may be, of certain subsidiaries, and real estate, but excluding our non-U.S. subsidiaries and all of our trademark portfolio.\\n\\nLetter of Credit Facilities\\n\\nAs of\\nJanuary 30, 2016, we maintained one U.S. dollar letter of credit facilities totaling $30.0 million and one letter of credit facility totaling $0.3 million utilized by our United Kingdom subsidiary. Each documentary letter of credit is secured\\nprimarily by the consignment of merchandise in transit under that letter of credit and certain subordinated liens on our assets.\\n\\nDuring\\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2016, a $15 million line of credit expired and was not renewed. During fiscal 2014, we decreased the letter of credit sublimit in our Senior Credit Facility to $30.0 million. At January 30, 2016 and January 31,\\n2015, there was $18.9 million and $33.7 million, respectively, available under the existing letter of credit facilities\\n\\nReal Estate Mortgage Loans\\n\\nIn July 2010, we paid off our then existing real estate mortgage loan and refinanced our main administrative office, warehouse and\\ndistribution facility in Miami with a $13.0 million mortgage loan. The loan is due on August 1, 2020. The interest rate has been modified since the refinancing date. The interest rate was 4.25% per annum and monthly payments of principal and\\ninterest of $71,000 were due, based on a 25-year amortization, with the outstanding principal due at maturity. In July 2013, we amended the mortgage loan agreement to modify the interest rate. The interest rate was reduced to 3.9% per annum and\\nthe terms were restated to reflect new monthly payments of principal and interest of $69,000, based on a 25-year amortization, with the outstanding principal due at maturity. At January 30, 2016, the balance of the real estate mortgage loan totaled\\n$11.0 million, net of discount, of which $357,000 is due within one year.\\n\\nIn June 2006, we entered into a mortgage loan for $15 million\\nsecured by our Tampa facility. The loan is due on January 23, 2019. The mortgage loan has been refinanced and the interest rate has been modified since such date. The interest rate was 4.00% per annum and quarterly payments of principal and\\ninterest of approximately $248,000 were due, based on a 20-year amortization, with the outstanding principal due at maturity. In January 2014, we amended the mortgage loan to modify the interest rate. The interest rate was reduced to 3.25% per\\nannum and the terms were restated to reflect new monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $68,000, based on a 20-year amortization, with the outstanding principal due at maturity. At January 30, 2016, the balance of the real\\nestate mortgage loan totaled $11.1 million, net of discount, of which approximately $460,000 is due within one year.\\n\\nThe real estate\\nmortgage loans contain certain covenants. We are not aware of any non-compliance with any of the covenants. If we violate any covenants, the lender under the real estate mortgage loan could declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be\\nimmediately due and payable, which we may not be able to satisfy. A covenant violation could constitute a cross-default under our senior credit facility, the letter of credit facilities and the indenture relating to our senior subordinated notes\\nresulting in all of our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, which we may not be able to satisfy.\\n\\n43\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Contingent Commitments\\n\\nThe following tables illustrate the balance of our contractual obligations and commercial contingent commitments as of January 30, 2016:\\n\\nPayments Due by Period\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nContractual Obligations\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nLess than 1 year\\n\\n1-3 years\\n\\n4-5 years\\n\\nAfter 5 years\\n\\nLong-term debt, net of interest\\n\\n$\\n\\n134,132\\n\\n$\\n\\n817\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,490\\n\\n$\\n\\n121,825\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nInterest on long-term debt (1)\\n\\n18,665\\n\\n4,739\\n\\n9,378\\n\\n4,548\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nOperating leases\\n\\n178,100\\n\\n22,369\\n\\n40,994\\n\\n36,158\\n\\n78,579\\n\\nCapital leases\\n\\n647\\n\\n263\\n\\n384\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nEmployee agreements\\n\\n1,500\\n\\n500\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nPension liability\\n\\n30,970\\n\\n30,970\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nRoyalty minimum guaranties\\n\\n37,175\\n\\n10,581\\n\\n14,795\\n\\n10,066\\n\\n1,733\\n\\nTotal contractual obligations\\n\\n$\\n\\n401,189\\n\\n$\\n\\n70,239\\n\\n$\\n\\n78,041\\n\\n$\\n\\n172,597\\n\\n$\\n\\n80,312\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncludes interest payments based on contractual terms and excludes interest on the senior credit facilty, which typically approximates $1.0 million to $2.0 million per year.\\n\\nAmount of Contingent Commitment Expiration Per Period\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nOther Commercial Contingent Commitments\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nLess than 1 year\\n\\n1-3 years\\n\\n4-5 years\\n\\nAfter 5 years\\n\\nStandby letters of credit\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,395\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,395\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nTotal commercial commitments\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,395\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,395\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nTotal contractual obligations and other commercial contingent commitments\\n\\n$\\n\\n412,584\\n\\n$\\n\\n81,634\\n\\n$\\n\\n78,041\\n\\n$\\n\\n172,597\\n\\n$\\n\\n80,312\\n\\nAt January 30, 2016, we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest and\\npenalties totaling $1.1 million. Due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur in relation to these liabilities, and thus this\\nliability is not included in the above tables.\\n\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\n\\nWe are not a party to any \\\"off-balance sheet arrangements,\\\" as defined by applicable GAAP and SEC rules.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\n\\nDerivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts are recognized in the financial statements\\nand measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or stockholders' equity (as a component of comprehensive income),\\ndepending on whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge of changes in fair value or cash flows. When designated as a hedge of changes in fair value, the effective portion of the hedge is recognized as an offset in income with a\\ncorresponding adjustment to the hedged item. When designated as a hedge of changes in cash flows, the effective portion of the hedge is recognized as an offset in comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the hedged item and recognized\\nin income in the same period as the hedged item is settled. See \\\"Item 7A \\u2013 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\\" for further discussion about derivative financial instruments.\\n\\nEffects of Inflation and Foreign Currency Fluctuations\\n\\nWe do not believe that inflation or foreign currency fluctuations significantly affected our financial position and results of operations as of\\nand for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016.\\n\\n44\\n\\nTable of Contents\",\n          \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statement because of various factors, including, without limitation, those described in the sections titled \\\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\\\" and Part I, Item 1A \\\"Risk Factors\\\" of this Annual Report.\\n\\nIntroductory Note about the Merger Transaction\\n\\nEffective as of March 24, 2015 (the \\\"Effective Time\\\"), we completed the combination of C&J Energy Services, Inc. (\\\"Legacy C&J\\\") with the completion and production services business (the \\\"C&P Business\\\") of Nabors Industries Ltd. (\\\"Nabors\\\") pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the \\\"Merger Agreement\\\"), dated as of June 25, 2014, by and among Legacy C&J, Nabors, Nabors Red Lion Limited (subsequently renamed C&J Energy Services Ltd., \\\"New C&J\\\"), Nabors CJ Merger Co. and CJ Holding Co. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Nabors separated the C&P Business from the rest of its operations and consolidated this business under New C&J. A Delaware subsidiary of New C&J then merged with and into Legacy C&J, with Legacy C&J continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of New C&J (such transactions referred to herein collectively as the \\\"Merger\\\").  As of the Effective Time, common shares of Legacy C&J were converted into common shares of New C&J on a 1-for-1 basis, New C&J was renamed \\\"C&J Energy Services Ltd.\\\" and its common shares began trading on the NYSE under the symbol \\\"CJES\\\", which was previously used by Legacy C&J following completion of our initial public offering in 2011. After giving effect to the Merger, Nabors owned approximately 53% of our outstanding common shares, with Legacy C&J shareholders owning the remaining 47% of our outstanding common shares. As of February 23, 2016, Nabors owns approximately 52% of our outstanding shares. We are currently led primarily by the individuals who served as Legacy C&J's executive officers prior to the completion of the Merger.\\n\\nPursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, New C&J is the successor issuer to Legacy C&J following the closing of the Merger and is deemed to succeed to Legacy C&J's reporting history under the Exchange Act.  Because Legacy C&J was considered the accounting acquirer in the Transactions under U.S generally accepted accounting principles (\\\"GAAP\\\"), Legacy C&J is also considered the accounting predecessor of C&J Energy Services Ltd. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of C&J Energy Services Ltd. that cover periods prior to the completion of the Merger, reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of C&J Energy Services, Inc., the predecessor to C&J Energy Services Ltd., and do not reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of the C&P Business.  Accordingly, comparisons between our consolidated results following the completion of the Merger and results from prior periods may not be meaningful.\\n\\nReferences to \\\"C&J,\\\" the \\\"Company,\\\" \\\"we,\\\" \\\"us\\\" or \\\"our\\\" in this Annual Report are to New C&J, together with our consolidated subsidiaries when referring to periods following the completion of the Merger , and are to Legacy C&J , together with our consolidated subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to the completion of the Merger.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nWe are one of the largest, integrated providers of completion and production services in North America.  We provide a full range of well construction, well completions, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America. Our services, which are involved in the entire life cycle of the well, include directional drilling, cementing, hydraulic fracturing, cased-hole wireline, coiled tubing, rig services, fluids management services and other special well site services. We operate in all of the major oil and gas producing regions of the continental United States and Western Canada.  For the last few years we have been working to establish an operational presence in key countries in the Middle East, and we currently have an office and operational facility in Dubai and an operational facility in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nOur operating and financial performance is heavily influenced by drilling, completion and production activity by our customers in the upstream industry, and thus is significantly impacted by oil and natural gas prices. However, our performance also reflects the impact of our growth strategy, including our investments in strategic initiatives designed to strengthen, expand and diversify our company through service line diversification, vertical integration and technological advancement.  Please see \\\"Growth Strategy and Strategic Initiatives\\\" for additional discussion of our long term growth strategy and strategic initiatives.\\n\\n32\\n\\nGrowth Strategy and Strategic Initiatives\\n\\nOver the last few years, we have significantly invested in the execution of our long term growth strategy, which is focused on strengthening, expanding and diversifying our business through (1) the growth of our assets, customer base and geographic reach, both domestically and internationally, for our core service lines and (2) strategic initiatives advancing service line diversification; vertical integration and technological advancement.\\n\\nGrowth of Core Service Lines\\n\\nDuring 2015, we continued to focus on growing our core business through the expansion of our assets, customer base and geographic reach, both domestically and internationally, and most notably through the Merger.  The combination of Legacy C&J with the C&P Business greatly expanded our scale, service offerings and geographic reach, increasing capacity for our existing services offerings and providing diversification through the additional services offerings of the C&P Business with a  stronger presence in all major domestic basins. With the Merger closing during the early part of the market downturn, we have not yet been able to fully capitalize on many of the opportunities that we believe are available both domestically and internationally through our greater scale, enhanced offerings and significant operating efficiencies.\\n\\nService Line Diversification, Vertical Integration & Technological Advancement\\n\\nDuring 2015, we further advanced our ongoing strategic initiatives designed to strengthen, expand and diversify our business through service line diversification, vertical integration and technological advancement.  In implementing our long term growth strategy, in addition to the diversification of our services through the Merger, in May 2015, we acquired an integrated business that designs, manufactures and installs electrical submersible pump systems and accessories primarily for artificial lift applications. In addition to offering a wide variety of products that support artificial lift installations, we are also developing a line of electrical submersible pump systems that are optimized for the small casing sizes typical of long horizontal wells. We believe that this business has significant growth potential when the market eventually recovers, both in the U.S. and abroad and also has the potential to provide a competitive advantage for our Well Support Services segment.\\n\\nAdditionally, we acquired an equipment manufacturing business in 2011 and a data acquisition and control systems business in 2013. We utilize the equipment and products manufactured by these vertically integrated businesses in our day-to-day operations, and we also sell them to third-party customers in the global energy services industry. During 2013, we also began organically developing a specialty chemicals supply business for completion and production services. We source many of the chemicals and fluids used in our hydraulic fracturing operations through this business, which provides cost savings to us and also gives us direct control over the design, development and supply of these products. Additionally, we have taken a multi-faceted, integrated approach to developing our directional drilling capabilities. In April 2013, we acquired a provider of directional drilling technology and related downhole tools. Building on that technology, during the first half of 2014 we began manufacturing premium drilling motors in-house and during the second quarter of 2014 we introduced our directional drilling services line to customers as a new service offering.\\n\\nOver the last several years we have also significantly invested in our research and technology capabilities, including the development of a state-of-the-art research and technology center with a team of engineers and support staff. We believe that one of the strategic benefits of this division is the ability to develop and implement new technologies and respond to changes in customers' requirements and industry demand. Our efforts to date have been focused on developing innovative, fit-for-purpose solutions designed to enhance our core service offerings, increase completion efficiencies, provide cost savings to our operations and add value for our customers. Several of our research and technology initiatives are now generating monthly cost savings for our expanded, integrated completion services operations, which is central to our overall strategy of proactively managing our costs to maximize returns. Additionally, several of these investments are already delivering value added products and services that, in addition to producing revenue, are creating increasing demand from key customers.\\n\\nAs a result of these efforts, in 2015, we introduced several new products and progressed on differentiating technologies that we believe will provide a competitive advantage as our customers focus on extracting oil and gas in the most economical and efficient ways possible.\\n\\nOur Operating Segments\\n\\nWe currently operate in three reportable business segments:\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nCompletion Services, which includes the hydraulic fracturing services, cased-hole wireline services, and coiled tubing services and other well stimulation services lines of both Legacy C&J and the C&P Business.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWell Support Services, which includes services lines acquired with the C&P Business, specifically including rig services, fluid management services and other special well site services.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOther Services, which include Legacy C&J's smaller service lines and divisions, including directional drilling services, equipment manufacturing and repair, specialty chemicals sales, research and technology, and Middle East operations, as well as the C&P Business' cementing services line. We also manage several of our vertically integrated business through our research and technology division, including our data acquisition and control instruments provider and artificial lift applications provider. Costs associated with general corporate activities and intersegment eliminations are also included in this Other Services segment.\\n\\nDue to the transformative nature of the Merger, upon closing of the Merger, our chief operating decision maker (the \\\"CODM\\\") changed the way in which the Company is managed, including a revised operating segment approach in making performance evaluation and resource allocation decisions. Discrete financial information was created to provide the information necessary for our CODM to manage our combined company under the revised operating segment structure. As a result of this change in operating segments, we revised our reportable segments during the first quarter of 2015. The current reportable business segment structure reflects the financial information and reports used by management, including our CODM, to make decisions regarding our business, including with respect to evaluating performance and allocating resource.  We have recast the segment information included in this Annual Report to reflect the new reportable segment structure in order to conform to the current year presentation.\\n\\nOur reportable business segments are described in more detail below; for financial information about our segments, including revenue from external customers and total assets by segment, see \\\"Note 11 - Segment Information\\\" in Part II, Item 8 \\\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" of this Annual Report.\\n\\nCompletion Services\\n\\nOur Completion Services segment currently consists of the following service lines: (1) hydraulic fracturing; (2) cased-hole wireline, which includes wireline logging, perforating, pressure pumping ,well site make-up and pressure testing and other complementary services; and (3) coiled tubing and other well stimulation services, including nitrogen and pressure pumping services. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our hydraulic fracturing services line.\\n\\nOur Completion Services segment consists of over 1.2 million hydraulic horsepower, over 130 wireline units and over 40 coiled tubing units, having significantly increased our asset base as a result of the Merger.  However, not all of these assets are utilized fully or at all at any time, due to, among other things, scheduled maintenance and downtime.  Additionally, in response to the continued deterioration in market conditions over the course of the year, we implemented aggressive cost control measures and aligned our assets with industry demand, which included stacking or idling unproductive equipment across our asset base within each service line.\\n\\nManagement evaluates our Completion Services segment operations' performance and allocates resources primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA because it provides important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business within this segment. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure computed as total earnings (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), net, net gain or loss on disposal of assets, transaction costs, and non-routine items.\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from our Completion Services segment was $1.2 billion, representing approximately 70% of our total revenue, compared with revenue of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents a 23% year-over-year decrease.  Adjusted EBITDA from this segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $73.9 million, compared with $344.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents a 79% year-over-year decrease.  Even with our significantly expanded asset base and diversified market presence as a result of the Merger, our financial results declined as a result of the extremely challenging market conditions that characterized the year.  Specifically, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by significantly lower overall utilization and pricing levels experienced to varying degrees across our service lines and markets during the 2015 year, resulting from decreased demand by our customers in an extremely competitive environment caused by the continued decline in U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity as a result of depressed commodity prices.\\n\\nWith respect to the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue from our Completion Services segment was $256.6 million, representing approximately 63% of our total revenue, compared with revenue of $256.9 million for the third quarter of 2015.\\n\\n34\\n\\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA from this segment was $10.0 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of ($8.6 million) for the third quarter of 2015, which represents a 217% sequential increase.  Utilization levels for our Completion Services improved entering the fourth quarter, although we continued to experience significant pricing pressure throughout the quarter and activity declined with the typical year-end seasonal slowdown.  Hydraulic fracturing activity was strong in October, but as we moved through the quarter and activity slowed, we strategically stacked additional equipment and focused on capturing higher overall utilization levels across our active equipment base.  Our strategy, which included concentrating on key customers in core basins, aggressively managing our operational cost structure and stacking our lower utilized equipment, produced improved profitability despite the challenging headwinds we faced in the back half of the quarter.  In our coiled tubing service line, utilization increased at the beginning of the quarter, but activity began to decline as the effects of the seasonal slowdown impacted our operations and customers delayed previously scheduled work.  In our wireline service line, both pricing and utilization remained depressed and continued to weaken with the falling rig count, seasonal slowdown and inclement weather experienced during the course of the quarter.\\n\\nAs we entered the first quarter of 2016, our Completion Services segment experienced a significant decline in activity that has remained depressed.  We are keeping a sharp focus on managing our operations and controlling costs, including closing additional facilities, further reducing headcount, stacking idle equipment and lowering our cost structure to ensure our operations remain aligned with market conditions. The implementation of this strategy over the course of the fourth quarter enabled us to protect market share and deliver an approximate $18.6 million sequential improvement in Adjusted EBITDA for this segment.  We will continue to focus on servicing the needs of our core customer base, and make the appropriate decisions as needed, to more effectively align our operations with current market conditions.\\n\\nWell Support Services\\n\\nOur Well Support Services segment, which was acquired in the Merger as part of the C&P Business, currently consists of the following service lines: (1) rig services, including providing workover and well servicing rigs that are involved in routine repair and maintenance, completions, re-drilling and plug and abandonment operations; (2) fluid management services, including manufacturing, transportation, storage and disposal services for fluids used in the drilling, completion and workover of oil and gas well; and (3) other special well site services.  Our rig services line is the greatest driver of revenue for this segment.\\n\\nOur Well Support Services segment consists of 519 workover rigs utilized by the rig services line and a fleet of 1,425 fluid services trucks, 5,258 frac tanks and 30 salt water disposal wells utilized by our fluid management services line. However, not all of these assets are utilized fully or at all at any time, due to, among other things, scheduled maintenance and downtime.  Additionally, in response to the continued deterioration in market conditions over the course of the year, we implemented aggressive cost control measures and aligned our assets with industry demand, which included stacking or idling unproductive equipment across our asset base within each service line.\\n\\nManagement evaluates our Well Support Services segment operations' performance and allocates resources primarily based on activity levels, specifically rig and trucking hours, as well as Adjusted EBITDA.  The following table presents rig and trucking hours for our Well Support Services for the period from the Merger date, March 24, 2015 through December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):\\n\\nYear Ended\\n\\nDecember 31, 2015\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n455.8\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n\\n$\\n\\n72.3\\n\\nTotal rigs\\n\\n519\\n\\nTotal rig hours\\n\\n465,926\\n\\nTotal trucks\\n\\n1,425\\n\\nTotal truck hours\\n\\n1,653,417\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from our Well Support Services segment was $455.8 million, representing approximately 26% of our total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA from this segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $72.3 million. The entire Well Services segment was acquired in connection with the Merger; as such, we had no revenues or Adjusted EBITDA from this segment for the year ended December 31, 2014.\\n\\n35\\n\\nWith respect to the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue from our Well Support Services segment was $135.7 million, representing approximately 33% of our total revenue, compared to revenue of $150.9 million for the third quarter of 2015, which represents a 10% decrease quarter over quarter.\\n\\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA from this segment was $22.3 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 million for the third quarter of 2015, which represents a 6% sequential decrease.\\n\\nRevenue from our Well Support Services segment was negatively impacted by the typical year-end slowdown and continued pricing pressure.  Despite increased demand for our services in October, the seasonal slowdown around the holidays resulted in rigs being released in several core operating basins.  We also encountered some weakness in areas that typically maintain strong fourth quarter activity, such as Canada, due to low commodity prices.  During the quarter, we supported utilization and protected market share through pricing concessions, while repositioning equipment and resources in line with market conditions and customer demand.  Despite declining revenue, our continued focus on restructuring this segment, enhancing efficiencies and aggressively reducing costs, allowed us to generate a sequential Adjusted EBITDA margin increase of approximately 80 basis points.\\n\\nAs with our Completion Services segment, activity and pricing levels for our Well Support Services segment declined and have remained depressed entering the first quarter of 2016.  Our customers continue to focus on lowering their costs due to the continued weakness in commodity prices, and we will continue to work with them to the best of our ability to sustain utilization, protect market share and capitalize on strategic opportunities.\\n\\nOther Services\\n\\nThe Other Services segment is comprised of Legacy C&J's smaller service lines and divisions, currently including directional drilling services, equipment manufacturing and repair, data acquisition and control instruments, artificial lift applications, specialty chemical sales, Middle East operations, and research and technology, as well as the C&P Business' cementing operations.  Also included in the Other Services are intersegment eliminations and costs associated with activities of a general corporate nature.\\n\\nOur Other Services segment contributed $76.1 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing approximately 4% of our total revenue, compared with $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents a 190% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA from this segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was ($99.4 million) compared with ($91.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents an 8% year-over-year decrease. Like our core services lines, the businesses comprising our Other Services Segment were negatively impacted by the widespread reduction in drilling, completion and production activity over the course of the year.\\n\\nWith respect to the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue from our Other Services segment was $16.7 million, representing approximately 4% of our total revenue, compared to revenue of  $19.7 million for the third quarter of 2015, which represents a 16% decrease quarter over quarter.  Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA from this segment was ($24.6 million), compared to Adjusted EBITDA of ($26.4 million) for the third quarter of 2015, which represents a 7% sequential increase. Like our core services lines, the businesses comprising our Other Services segment were negatively impacted by the falling rig count and the typical year-end slowdown.  In spite of declining activity levels, we were able to sequentially grow revenue within two of our most promising R&T initiatives: directional drilling and artificial lift applications.  Additionally, in spite of a more than 15% reduction in revenue from this segment during the fourth quarter, Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 7% as a result of our continued efforts to cut overhead costs and align our active R&T initiatives with current market conditions.\\n\\nOperating Overview & Strategy\\n\\nOur results of operations are driven primarily by deviations in four interrelated, fluctuating variables: (1) the drilling, completion and production activities of our customers, which directly affects the demand for our services; (2) the price we are able to charge for our services, which is driven by the level of demand for our services and equipment capacity in the market; (3) the cost of products and labor involved in providing our services, and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers; and (4) our activity, or \\\"utilization\\\" levels, and service performance.\\n\\nOur operating strategy is focused on maintaining high asset utilization levels to maximize revenue generation while controlling cost to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the quality and efficiency of our service execution and aligning with customers who recognize the value that C&J provides through efficiency gains are central to our efforts to support utilization and grow our business.  However, asset utilization is not necessarily indicative of our financial and/or operational performance and should not be given undue reliance. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity\\n\\n36\\n\\ndrivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle.\\n\\nThe Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data, which is publicly available on a weekly basis, is widely accepted and used as an indicator of overall exploration and production (\\\"E&P\\\") company capital spending and resulting oilfield activity levels. Historically, our utilization levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore spending by our E&P company customers as a group. Generally, as capital spending by E&P companies increases, drilling, completion and production activity also increases, resulting in increased demand for our services, and therefore more days or hours worked (as the case may be). Conversely, when drilling, completion and production activity levels decline due to lower spending by E&P companies, we generally provide fewer services, which results in fewer days or hours worked (as the case may be). Additionally, during periods of decreased spending by E&P companies, we may be required to discount our rates or provide other pricing concessions to remain competitive and support utilization, which negatively impacts our revenue and operating margins. During periods of pricing weakness for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, and our ability to achieve any cost reductions from our suppliers typically lag the decline in pricing for our services, which could further adversely affect our results. For additional information about factors impacting our business and results of operations, please see \\\"Industry Trends and Outlook\\\" in this Part II, Item 7. \\\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\\"\\n\\nManagement evaluates the performance of our operating segments primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA because it provides important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business within each segment and aids us in analytical comparisons for purposes of, among other things, efficiently allocating our assets and resources. Our management team also monitors asset utilization, among other factors, for purposes of assessing our overall activity levels and customer demand. For our Completion Services operations, we measure our asset utilization levels primarily by the total number of days that our asset base works on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month, which excludes scheduled maintenance days. We generally consider an asset to be working such days that it is at or in transit to a job location, regardless of the number of hours worked or whether it generated any revenue during such time. In our Well Support Services operations, we measure activity levels for primarily by the number of hours our assets work on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month. However, given the variance in revenue and profitability from job to job within each of our core service lines, depending on the type of services to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed, asset utilization cannot be relied on as indicative of our financial or operating performance.\\n\\nIndustry Trends and Outlook\\n\\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. Although many factors contributing to these risks are beyond our ability to control, we continuously monitor these risks and have taken steps to mitigate them to the extent practicable. In addition, while we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives and, consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Please read the factors described in the sections titled \\\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\\\" and \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information about the known material risks that we face.\\n\\nGeneral Industry Trends\\n\\nThe oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and gas, current and expected future prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and workover budget. The oil and gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, weather conditions, and other factors that are beyond our control. Declines and sustained weakness in commodity prices over the course of 2015 and into 2016, and the consequent negative impact on the level of exploration, development and production activity and capital expenditures by our customers, have adversely affected the demand for our services and, absent a significant rebound in commodity prices and corresponding increase in exploration, development and production activity by our customers, are expected to adversely affect demand for our services in the future. This, in turn, negatively impacts our ability to maintain utilization of assets and negotiate pricing at levels generating sufficient margins, especially in our hydraulic fracturing business.\\n\\n37\\n\\nDemand for our services tends to be extremely volatile and cyclical, as it is a direct function of our customers' willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Western Canada. Our customers' willingness to undertake such activities and expenditures depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control, including, among other things, current and expected future levels of oil and gas prices and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and gas. Oil and gas prices, and therefore the level of drilling, completion and workover activity by our customers, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. For example, during 2015 and to date, oil prices reached and remained at their lowest levels since 2009, declining to as low as $26 per barrel, but with highs at $61 per barrel. Gas prices declined in 2009 and have remained depressed relative to historical levels.\\n\\nDeclines or sustained weakness in oil and gas prices influences our customers to curtail their operations, reduce their capital expenditures, and request pricing concessions to reduce their operating costs.  We have experienced a significant increase in each of these customer responses to the current commodity price environment since January 1, 2016 . The demand for drilling, completion and workover services is driven by available investment capital for such activities and in a lower oil and gas price environment, demand for service and maintenance generally decreases as oil and gas producers decrease their activity and expenditures. Because the type of services that we offer can be easily \\\"started\\\" and \\\"stopped,\\\" and oil and gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we typically experience a more rapid decline in demand for our services compared with demand for other types of energy services. A prolonged low level of customer activity will adversely affect the demand for our services and our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nCompetition and Demand for Our Services\\n\\nWe operate in highly competitive areas of the energy services industry with significant potential for excess capacity. Completion and well servicing equipment can be moved with relative ease from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area. Additionally, the demand for our services depends primarily on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for drilling, completion and production activities, which are affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices and numerous other factors over which we have no control.  Utilization and pricing for our services have in the past been negatively affected by increases in supply relative to demand in our core operating areas and geographic markets.\\n\\nOur revenues and earnings are directly affected by changes in utilization and pricing levels for our services, which fluctuate in response to changes in the level of drilling, completion and workover activity by our customers. Pressure on pricing for our core services, including due to competition and industry and/or economic conditions, may impact, among other things, our ability to maintain utilization and pricing for our services or implement price increases. During periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our results. Furthermore, even when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset any rising costs. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our utilization levels. The inability to maintain our utilization and pricing levels, or to increase our prices as costs increase, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\\n\\nOur competitors include many large and small energy service companies, including some of the largest integrated energy services companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Our larger competitors' greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can, including by reducing prices for services. Our major competitors for our Completion Services include Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, CalFrac Well Services, Trican, Weatherford International, RPC, Inc., Pumpco, a subsidiary of Superior Energy Services, Frac Tech, Basic Energy Services and Archer, as well as a significant number of regional businesses. Our major competitors for our Well Support Services include Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Key Energy Services, Basic Energy Services, Superior Energy Services, Precision, Forbes, Pioneer, as well as a significant number of regional businesses.\\n\\nGenerally, we believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets that we serve are price, technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force capability, safety record, reputation and experience. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded work, particularly during times of weak commodity prices like we experienced during 2015 and continue to experience to date. Additionally, projects for certain of our core service lines are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to further increase competition based primarily on price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on the safety, performance and quality of our crews, equipment and services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our major competitors by our operating philosophy, which is focused on delivering the highest quality customer service and equipment, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency. As part of this strategy, we target high\\n\\n38\\n\\nvolume, high efficiency customers with service intensive, 24-hour work, which is where we believe we can differentiate our services from our competitors.\\n\\nCurrent Market Conditions and Outlook\\n\\nAs we entered 2015, we experienced a slowdown in activity across our customer base as operators reacted to the rapid decline in commodity prices that began during the fourth quarter of 2014.  The entire year proved to be extremely challenging for the North American oilfield services industry due to the sustained weakness and volatility in oil prices at levels that resulted in severe reductions in drilling, completion and production activities.  This resulted in a significant decrease in demand for our services, with reductions in customer budgets driving severe utilization declines, and increased competition and pricing pressure to varying degrees across our service lines and operating areas.  As our customers reduced their service needs and budgets, we worked with them, including through pricing concessions, when necessary to secure utilization and protect market share across our service lines, while also seeking ways to deliver greater efficiencies and reduce our operating costs. However, our financial and operating results were adversely impacted by the weak activity and pricing environment characterizing this downturn.\\n\\nIn response to challenging market conditions, and also as part of our integration plan in anticipation of the Merger, late in the first quarter of 2015 we began to scale back our operations and align our cost structure with activity levels.  We idled equipment, reduced headcount, implemented strict cost control measures and negotiated substantial price reductions with suppliers to lower our operating costs.  However, our ability to obtain cost reductions from our third-party suppliers lagged behind the drop in pricing for our services, which further compressed margins.  With the Merger closing during the early part of the downturn, we had the impetus to double-down on our efforts to streamline our combined company and to further improve our cost structure, leveraging our greater scale.  We stacked unproductive equipment, further reduced head count, including through the elimination of duplicative personnel, closed or consolidated facilities, and implemented other measures to bring our operations and cost-structure in-line with existing activity levels and anticipated instability over the near term.\\n\\nIn the face of challenging headwinds, we successfully completed the integration of Legacy C&J and the C&P business ahead of schedule, which involved a substantial effort across our employee base to integrate the numerous systems and functions in a timely manner.   We achieved greater synergies than originally anticipated, and at an accelerated pace.  For example, we achieved procurement synergy savings from applying more favorable pricing on key consumables, such as proppant, trucking and chemicals, to our expanded Completion Services operations, and the elimination of duplicative personnel and facilities provided some synergy savings with respect to corporate overhead and administrative expenses.  Additionally, through our various R&T initiatives we became more vertically integrated, which has enabled us to continue to reduce our cost structure, creating opportunities to drive revenue and gain market share.\\n\\nLooking forward, the severity and duration of this downturn remain uncertain and we are preparing for industry conditions to remain extremely challenging through 2016. Activity and pricing levels have declined since the beginning of the year, which will negatively impact our first quarter financial and operating results. We are actively monitoring the market and managing our business in line with demand for services, and we will continue to make adjustments as necessary to effectively respond to the challenging conditions, including further scaling back our strategic initiatives and both core and non-core businesses. We are maintaining an intense focus on lowering our input and labor costs, driving costs savings and controlling expenses.  Our top priorities remain to drive revenue by maximizing utilization, improve margins through cost controls, protect and grow market share by focusing on the quality and efficiency of our service execution and ensure we are strategically positioned to capitalize on any future market improvement or compelling opportunities. Although we believe that we are prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, the  ultimate impact of the current industry downturn on our company will depend upon various factors, many of which remain beyond our control.  Please see \\\"Liquidity and Capital Resources\\\" in this Part II, Item 7 \\\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\\\" in addition to \\\" Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\\\" and \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\\n\\nResults of Operations\\n\\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our results for the 2015 year include the financial and operating results of Legacy C&J for the entire period and the C&P Business from the Effective Time of the Merger (March 24, 2015) through December 31, 2015. Results for periods prior to March 24, 2015 reflect the financial and operating results of Legacy C&J exclusively, and do not include the financial and operating results of the C&P Business. Accordingly, comparisons of 2015 results to prior years may not be meaningful. In addition to the Merger, we have significantly grown our company since the beginning of 2014 as we\\n\\n39\\n\\nexecuted our long term growth strategy and demonstrated our commitment to diversify and expand our business.  As a result of our efforts, as well as market fluctuations, neither our 2015 nor our 2014 results are directly comparable to prior years.\\n\\nFurthermore, for the first quarter of 2015, we revised our reportable segments to reflect the change in our operating segments as a result of the Merger. Due to the transformative nature of the Merger, our chief operating decision maker (the \\\"CODM\\\") changed the way in which the Company is managed, which included a revised segment approach in making performance evaluation and resource allocation decisions. Discrete financial information was created to provide the segment information necessary for the CODM to manage the Company under the revised operating segment structure.  The current reportable business segment structure reflects the financial information and reports used by management, including our CODM, to make decisions regarding the Company's business, including performance evaluation and resource allocation decisions.  We have recast the segment information included in this Annual Report to reflect the new reportable segment structure in order to conform to the current year presentation.\\n\\nResults for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the change in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands):\\n\\nYears Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n$ Change\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,748,889\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,607,944\\n\\n$\\n\\n140,945\\n\\nCosts and expenses:\\n\\nDirect costs\\n\\n1,523,116\\n\\n1,179,227\\n\\n343,889\\n\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n\\n239,775\\n\\n182,518\\n\\n57,257\\n\\nResearch and development\\n\\n16,704\\n\\n14,327\\n\\n2,377\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n\\n276,353\\n\\n108,145\\n\\n168,208\\n\\nImpairment Expense\\n\\n791,807\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n791,807\\n\\nLoss on disposal of assets\\n\\n(544\\n\\n)\\n\\n(17\\n\\n)\\n\\n(527\\n\\n)\\n\\nOperating income\\n\\n(1,098,322\\n\\n)\\n\\n123,744\\n\\n(1,222,066\\n\\n)\\n\\nOther income (expense):\\n\\nInterest expense, net\\n\\n(82,086\\n\\n)\\n\\n(9,840\\n\\n)\\n\\n(72,246\\n\\n)\\n\\nOther income (expense), net\\n\\n8,773\\n\\n598\\n\\n8,175\\n\\nTotal other expenses, net\\n\\n(73,313\\n\\n)\\n\\n(9,242\\n\\n)\\n\\n(64,071\\n\\n)\\n\\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\\n\\n(1,171,635\\n\\n)\\n\\n114,502\\n\\n(1,286,137\\n\\n)\\n\\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\\n\\n(299,093\\n\\n)\\n\\n45,679\\n\\n(344,772\\n\\n)\\n\\nNet income (loss)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(872,542\\n\\n)\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,823\\n\\n$\\n\\n(941,365\\n\\n)\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nRevenue increased $140.9 million , or 8.8% , for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenue was primarily due to our significantly larger asset base and expanded operations as a result of the Merger and the incremental impact of  $822.2 million of revenue contributed by the C&P Business, offset by a $681.3 million decrease in revenue from Legacy C&J due to significantly lower utilization and pricing levels across our Completion Services segment resulting from the extremely competitive market environment caused by the continued decline in U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity.\\n\\nDirect Costs\\n\\nDirect costs increased $343.9 million , or 29.2% , to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to our significantly larger asset base and expanded operations as a result of the Merger, including additional direct costs of $697.6 million from the C&P Business, partially offset by a $353.7 million decrease in direct cost attributable to Legacy C&J.\\n\\nAs a percentage of revenue, direct costs increased to 87.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, up from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to substantially lower pricing for our services due to competitive market conditions resulting from the rapid decline in commodity prices, partially offset by reductions to our cost structure achieved through our supply chain and procurement synergy savings following the Merger.\\n\\n40\\n\\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\\\"SG&A\\\") and Research and Development Expenses (\\\"R&D\\\")\\n\\nSG&A increased $57.3 million , or 31.4% , to $239.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding an increase of $22.5 million in acquisition-related costs, the remaining increase in SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by a significantly greater employee base as a result of the Merger, partially offset by the implementation of our integration plan following the Merger and market-driven cost control initiatives, including reductions in headcount and facilities.\\n\\nWe also incurred $16.7 million in R&D for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $14.3 million for the corresponding prior year period. We remain committed to investing in key technologies that we lower our cost base for key inputs, enhance synergy savings and improve our operational capabilities and efficiencies. However, as part of our cost control measures, during the latter half of 2015, we scaled back our research and technology division and delayed certain projects.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense (\\\"D&A\\\")\\n\\nD&A increased $168.2 million , or 155.5% , to $276.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $108.1 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in D&A was primarily related to our significantly larger asset base as a result of the Merger, as well as the deployment of new equipment in Legacy C&J's core service lines.\\n\\nImpairment Expense\\n\\nImpairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $791.8 million and consisted of $385.0 million of goodwill impairment and $393.1 million of property, plant and equipment (\\\"PP&E\\\") impairment, both related to the Completion Services and Other Services segments, and $13.8 million related to other intangible assets.\\n\\nDue to the continued downturn in the oil and gas industry, and the resulting further deterioration in demand for our services, we determined that it was necessary to test goodwill for impairment and to test PP&E and intangible assets for recoverability during the third quarter of 2015 and again during the fourth quarter of 2015.  As a result, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $394.2 million related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our Completion Services and Other Services segments for the third quarter of 2015, and we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $393.1 million related to impairment of PP&E from certain asset groups within each of our Completion Services segment and Other Services for the fourth quarter of 2015.\\n\\nNo impairment was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2014.\\n\\nInterest Expense, net\\n\\nInterest expense increased $72.2 million , or 734.2% , to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to higher levels of borrowings, primarily to finance the Merger.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, at an effective rate of 25.5%, compared to income tax expense of $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, at an effective rate of 39.9%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a pre-tax loss in the current year, as compared to pre-tax income in the prior year. The effective rate, and resulting benefit, is less than the expected statutory rate primarily due to impairment charges that were not deductible for tax, the impact of permanent differences on the tax rate and the recognition of non-deductible acquisition related costs.\\n\\nResults for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the change in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands):\\n\\n41\\n\\nYears Ended December 31,\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n$ Change\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,607,944\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,070,322\\n\\n$\\n\\n537,622\\n\\nCosts and expenses:\\n\\nDirect costs\\n\\n1,179,227\\n\\n751,468\\n\\n427,759\\n\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n\\n182,518\\n\\n124,404\\n\\n58,114\\n\\nResearch and development\\n\\n14,327\\n\\n5,005\\n\\n9,322\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n\\n108,145\\n\\n74,703\\n\\n33,442\\n\\nLoss on disposal of assets\\n\\n(17\\n\\n)\\n\\n527\\n\\n(544\\n\\n)\\n\\nOperating income\\n\\n123,744\\n\\n114,215\\n\\n9,529\\n\\nOther income (expense):\\n\\nInterest expense, net\\n\\n(9,840\\n\\n)\\n\\n(6,550\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3,290\\n\\n)\\n\\nOther income (expense), net\\n\\n598\\n\\n53\\n\\n545\\n\\nTotal other expenses, net\\n\\n(9,242\\n\\n)\\n\\n(6,497\\n\\n)\\n\\n(2,745\\n\\n)\\n\\nIncome before income taxes\\n\\n114,502\\n\\n107,718\\n\\n6,784\\n\\nIncome tax expense\\n\\n45,679\\n\\n41,313\\n\\n4,366\\n\\nNet income\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,823\\n\\n$\\n\\n66,405\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,418\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nRevenue increased $537.6 million, or 50.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our Completion Services segment contributed $403.2 million of additional revenue from our hydraulic fracturing services and $129.7 million of additional revenue from our wireline services. The increased revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven by high activity and service intensity levels, strong operational execution and the deployment of additional equipment across our service lines.\\n\\nDirect Costs\\n\\nDirect costs increased $427.8 million, or 56.9%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $751.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our Completion Services segment had $408.1 million of additional direct costs primarily from our hydraulic fracturing services and $69.7 million of additional direct costs from our wireline services, in each instance related to a corresponding increase in revenue. As a percentage of revenue, direct costs increased from 70.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased exposure to a highly competitive spot market for our hydraulic fracturing services, as well as increased volumes and costs for proppants and logistics due to a job-mix weighted towards greater service-intensive activity.\\n\\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\\\"SG&A\\\") and Research and Development Expenses (\\\"R&D\\\")\\n\\nSG&A increased $58.1 million, or 46.7%, to $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $124.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We also incurred $14.3 million in R&D for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\\n\\nExcluding $20.2 million in transaction costs associated primarily with the Transactions, the increases in SG&A and R&D were primarily due to increased costs associated with the continued investment in our strategic initiatives, including service line diversification, vertical integration, technological advancement and international expansion. Inclusive of both SG&A and R&D, our strategic initiatives contributed approximately $39.7 million of additional costs for the year ended December 31, 2014.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense (\\\"D&A\\\")\\n\\nD&A increased $33.4 million, or 44.8%, to $108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to the deployment of new incremental equipment for our hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing, wireline and pressure pumping service lines.\\n\\nInterest Expense, net\\n\\n42\\n\\nInterest expense increased $3.3 million, or 50.2%, to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to increased average debt balances.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe recorded income tax expense of $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, at an effective rate of 39.9%, compared to $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, at an effective rate of 38.4%. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in permanent differences between book and taxable income and foreign losses not benefited in income tax expense.\\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nCurrent Financial Condition and Liquidity\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 , we had a cash balance of approximately $25.9 million , $121.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined and discussed below) along with $12.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, and $ 1.05 billion outstanding under a Term Loan B (as defined and discussed below) comprised of a $570.7 million term loan B-1 and a $481.4 million term loan B-2. We also had $32.0 million in long-term capital lease obligations. The long-term debt balance is net of $52.4 million of original issue discount on the Term Loan B.  As of December 31, 2015 , the Revolving Credit Facility had $166.4 million available for borrowing based on $300.0 million of Revolver availability in accordance with the Collateral Coverage Covenant (as defined and discussed below) under the Amended Credit Agreement. We generated $103.0 million of cash from operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 .  Please see \\\"Financial Condition and Cash Flows\\\" below for information about net cash provided by or used in our operating, investing and financing activities.\\n\\nAs of February 23, 2016, we had a cash balance of approximately $93.6 million and $251.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility with $36.4 million available for additional borrowing based on $300.0 million of Revolver availability in accordance with the Collateral Coverage Covenant. While we do not have an immediate need for these funds to continue operations, management believes it prudent to ensure direct access to this capital over the course of 2016 in order to ensure the Company is in the best possible position to manage the current market environment.  As a result, absent the issuance of additional securities, alternative financing arrangements or the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, our operations for the foreseeable future will be funded from cash flow from operations, cash on hand and the remaining $36.4 million of availability that may be drawn in ordinary course from time to time. The additional draws of $130.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility since December 31, 2015 will result in approximately $1.1 million of additional interest expense for the first quarter of 2016, which may increase net loss and decrease cash flow from operations.\\n\\nOn September 29, 2015, we entered into the Amendments (as defined and discussed below) to our Credit Agreement that, among other things: (1) reduced the Revolver commitment from $600.0 million to $400.0 million, provided, however, that availability is subject to the newly implemented Collateral Coverage Covenant (herein so called), which limits availability to the greater of (i) $300.0 million and (ii) an amount derived from 80% of Eligible Receivables (as defined and discussed below) and 50% of Eligible Inventory (as defined and discussed below); (2) temporarily suspends the quarterly Total Leverage Ratio (as defined and discussed below) and Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined and discussed below) covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2015 through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017; (3) provides that upon reinstatement of the Total Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio, the required test levels initially will be more permissive than those in effect prior to the Amendments, and will gradually adjust to those prior levels over the subsequent fiscal quarters; (4) provides for new financial covenants that will apply in lieu of the Total Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio, including a quarterly Minimum EBITDA Target covenant (as defined and discussed below), commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and running through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, based on a negotiated EBITDA test; and (5) sets quarterly limitations on capital expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2015, and annual limitations on capital expenditures for the four fiscal quarter periods ending December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2017.  Please see \\\" - Description of Our Credit Agreement\\\" below and Note 2 - Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in Part II, Item 8 \\\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" for additional information about the Credit Agreement.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 , absent the Amendments, we would not have been in compliance with the Total Leverage Ratio or the Interest Coverage Ratio.  However, as of December 31, 2015 we are in compliance with the financial covenants required by the Amended Credit Agreement. If our activity and/or pricing levels remain at current levels or do not improve, we are at risk of not being able to comply with our minimum EBITDA Target covenant in future periods.\\n\\n43\\n\\nCapital expenditures totaled $166.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to maintenance of our existing equipment. In response to persistently challenging industry conditions, we have significantly scaled back our 2016 capital expenditure plan and capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to range from $75 million to $100 million.  These expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and cash on hand (including from our recent draws under our Revolver).\\n\\nOur current focus is on preserving liquidity by lowering our operating expenses, controlling costs, reducing capital expenditures and maximizing collection of receivables. Based on our existing operating performance, 2016 planned capital expenditures, and ongoing cost reduction measures, we currently believe that our cash flows from operations and existing capital, coupled with cash on hand and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital expenditure requirements over the next twelve months. Our ability to access additional sources of financing will be dependent on our operating cash flows and demand for our services, which could be negatively impacted due to the extreme volatility of commodity prices and declines in capital and debt markets.  Please see \\\" \\u2013 Description of Our Credit Agreement\\\" below for additional information about our Revolving Credit Facility as amended by the Amendments;  please also see \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of potential risks associated with our existing indebtedness and financial and restrictive covenant structure in light of current market conditions.\\n\\nSources of Liquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under senior secured debt facilities, including our Revolving Credit Facility.  Historically, our primary uses of capital were for the growth of our Company, including the Merger and other strategic acquisitions that complement and enhance our business, the purchase and maintenance of equipment for our core service lines, geographic expansion (both domestic and international), and our ongoing strategic initiatives, most notably including the advancement of our research and technology capabilities and vertical integration. Our capital expenditures, maintenance costs and other expenses have increased substantially over the last few years in line with the significant growth we have achieved and the ongoing execution of our long-term growth strategy.\\n\\nAs a result of the Merger, we have improved operational scale, as well as a greater combined lending base, coupled with the expected benefit of a lower cost of capital.  However, like our competitors, our operational and financial results have been significantly impacted by the current downturn, which in turn impacts our liquidity and financial flexibility, as well as our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.  Anticipating that we would not be able to comply with the Total Leverage Ratio or the Interest Coverage Ratio, on September 29, 2015, we entered into the Amendments to the Credit Agreement to obtain relief from those financial covenants.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015 , we are in compliance with the financial covenants required by the Amended Credit Agreement.  We believe the Amendments were a positive development for the Company, as we believe they provide us with the flexibility to continue to work through this challenging time for our industry.  However, in the event activity and/or pricing levels remain at current levels or do not improve, we may be unable to continue comply with these financial covenants in future periods. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants and financial covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests, including limitations on our ability to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens or indebtedness, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates and prepay certain indebtedness. Please see \\\" \\u2013 Description of Our Credit Agreement\\\" below and Note 2 \\u2013 Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in Part II, Item 8 \\\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" for additional information about our Credit Agreement, including the Amendments. Please also see \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\\n\\nLiquidity Outlook and Future Capital Requirements\\n\\nThe energy services business is capital-intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, upgrade and purchase equipment to meet our customers' needs and industry demand. To date, our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate, over the long-term, will continue to be:\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\ngrowth capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to acquire additional equipment and other assets, increase our service lines, expand geographically or advance other strategic initiatives for the purpose of growing our business; and\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\ncapital expenditures related to our existing equipment, such as maintenance and other activities to extend the useful life of partially or fully depreciated assets.\\n\\n44\\n\\nAdditionally, in the near term, we anticipate our capital requirements will consist almost entirely of capital expenditures related to our existing equipment, such as maintenance and other activities to extend the useful life of partially or fully depreciated assets.\\n\\nThe successful execution of our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows and /or raise additional capital as needed. Historically, we have been able to generate solid cash flows in spite of challenging market conditions and our free cash flow and balance sheet allowed us to be flexible with our approach to organic growth and acquisition opportunities. Our ability to fund future growth depends on our performance, which is impacted by factors beyond our control, including financial, business, economic and other factors, such as potential changes in customer preferences and pressure from competitors.  Our current level of indebtedness could limit our ability to finance future growth and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Additionally, the financial and other restrictive covenant obligations contained in the Credit Agreement may restrict our operational flexibility and limit our ability to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens or indebtedness, sell or otherwise dispose of their assets, make certain restricted payments and investments and prepay certain indebtedness.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 , absent the Amendments, we would not have been in compliance with the Total Leverage Ratio or the Interest Coverage Ratio covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.  Anticipating that we would not be able to comply with the Total Leverage Ratio or the Interest Coverage Ratio, on September 29, 2015, we entered into the Amendments to the Credit Agreement to obtain relief from those financial covenants.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015 , we are in compliance with the financial covenants required by the Amended Credit Agreement.  However, in the event activity and/or pricing for our services remains at current levels or do not improve, we may be unable to continue comply with these financial covenants in future periods. Please see \\\" \\u2013 Description of Our Credit Agreement\\\" below and Note 2 \\u2013 Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in Part II, Item 8 \\\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" of this Annual Report for additional information about the Credit Agreement; please see \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of potential risks associated with our existing indebtedness and financial covenant structure in light of current market condition.\\n\\nOver the past two years, we have significantly invested in growing our core service lines through the expansion of our assets, customer base and geographic reach, both domestically and internationally.  We have also significantly invested in advancing our ongoing strategic initiatives designed to strengthen, expand and diversify our business, notably including service line diversification, vertical integration and technological advancement. Our continued investments in international expansion and our strategic initiatives have resulted in increased capital expenditures and costs, and as we execute our long-term growth strategy and further develop our strategic initiatives, we anticipate that our costs and expenses will continue to increase. To date, neither our international operations nor our strategic initiatives have contributed significant third-party revenue; however, we expect that they will contribute meaningful third-party revenue over the long term.\\n\\nEntering 2015 we experienced a slowdown in activity across our customer base as operators reacted to the rapid decline in commodity prices that began during the fourth quarter of 2014. This resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure to varying degrees across our service lines and operating areas. Activity levels across our operations have remained depressed throughout 2015.  Our 2015 financial and operating performance was negatively impacted by the continued weakness in demand for our services, with reductions in customer budgets and drilling and completion activity driving severe utilization declines and pricing pressure.  Although the severity and duration of this downturn remains uncertain, absent a significant recovery in commodity prices, we expect that activity and pricing levels will remain depressed, which will negatively impact our financial and operating results over the near term, in spite of the aggressive actions we have taken, and are taking, to scale back our operations and align our cost structure with the highly competitive market environment.\\n\\nGiven the challenging market conditions currently facing our industry, we significantly scaled back our 2016 capital expenditure plan to focus on capital expenditures related to our existing equipment, including maintenance and other activities purposed to extend the useful life of our assets. Based on our existing operating performance, 2016 planned capital expenditures and ongoing cost reduction measures, we currently believe that our cash flows from operations and existing capital, coupled with cash on hand and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital expenditure requirements over the next twelve months.\\n\\nGiven the investments we have made in expanding our service lines, including through investing in new equipment, coupled with our vertically integrated equipment manufacturing and repair business and research and technology capabilities, we believe that we have built a strong platform that will enable us to perform at the highest level through this current downturn and when the market recovers.  With respect to our strategic initiatives, we believe that the strategic investments in vertical integration and our research and technology capabilities that we have made, and our efforts to lower our cost base for key\\n\\n45\\n\\ninputs and improve our operational capabilities and efficiencies, will help us manage through this down-cycle. Several of our research and technology initiatives are now generating monthly cost savings to our Completion Services operations and are also helping to generate revenue. Although the financial benefits are still minimal at this time, we believe that these strategic projects will deliver meaningful cost savings to us over the long term. Even as we seek to reduce costs, we remain committed to investing in key technologies that lower our cost base for key inputs, enhance synergy savings and improve our operational capabilities and efficiencies.  However, we will continue to monitor the economic environment and demand for our services and adjust our business strategy as necessary to effectively respond to the market.  If this current industry downturn persists or worsens, we are prepared to delay further investment in these projects in line with any sustained market weakness and to take the necessary steps to further protect our company and maximize value for all of our shareholders.\\n\\nFinancial Condition and Cash Flows\\n\\nThe net cash provided by or used in our operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below (in thousands):\\n\\nYears Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nCash flow provided by (used in):\\n\\nOperating activities\\n\\n$\\n\\n103,005\\n\\n$\\n\\n181,837\\n\\n$\\n\\n181,101\\n\\nInvesting activities\\n\\n(825,156\\n\\n)\\n\\n(343,412\\n\\n)\\n\\n(165,295\\n\\n)\\n\\nFinancing activities\\n\\n734,126\\n\\n157,178\\n\\n(15,834\\n\\n)\\n\\nEffect of exchange rate on cash\\n\\n3,908\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nDecrease (increase) in cash and cash equivalents\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,883\\n\\n$\\n\\n(4,397\\n\\n)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(28\\n\\n)\\n\\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $78.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to (a) the decline in net income during the year ended December 31, 2015, after excluding the effects of changes in non-cash items, (b) cash used to satisfy obligations related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities assumed in the C&P Business acquisition and (c) incremental cash used to pay down accounts payable, partially offset by positive changes which included an increase in cash provided from the collection of accounts receivable assumed in the C&P Business acquisition and operating assets and liabilities related to normal fluctuations in the timing of cash collections and cash requirements.\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the increase in net income during 2014, after excluding the effects of changes in non-cash items, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities which included (a) incremental cash used to satisfy inventory levels primarily due to vertical integration efforts and (b) incremental cash used from changes in other operating assets and liabilities related to our growth and from normal fluctuations due to the timing of cash collections and cash requirements.\\n\\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $481.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the cash consideration of $693.5 million paid at the closing of the Merger for the acquisition of the C&P Business, partially offset by a $43.4 million purchase price reduction for the C&P Business related to a working capital adjustment and a decline in capital expenditure purchases as a result of the downturn in the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $178.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to a $155.8 million increase in capital expenditures primarily related to new equipment additions in our Stimulation and Well Intervention Services and Wireline Services segments, as well as a $33.2 million for the Tiger Acquisition.\\n\\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\\n\\n46\\n\\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $576.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase is primarily related to proceeds received from our Credit Agreement to fund the cash consideration portion of the acquisition of the C&P Business at the closing of the Merger as well as to pay off the long-term debt of Legacy C&J.\\n\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $15.8 million for the same period in 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities increased $173.0 million primarily due to net borrowings from our credit facility to fund increased capital expenditures related to new equipment, the Tiger Acquisition, and transaction costs associated with the Pending Nabors Transaction.\\n\\nDescription of Our Credit Agreement\\n\\nIn connection with the closing of the Merger, we entered into a new credit agreement, dated as of March 24, 2015 (the \\\"Original Credit Agreement\\\"), among C&J, CJ Lux Holdings S.\\u00e0 r.l. (\\\"Luxco\\\"), CJ Holding Co, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the \\\"Administrative Agent\\\"), Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders party thereto. The Original Credit Agreement provided for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.66 billion, consisting of (a) a $600.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and (b) a Term Loan B in the aggregate principal amount of $1.06 billion.\\n\\nOn September 29, 2015, we entered into a waiver and second amendment (the \\\"Waiver and Second Amendment\\\") and a third amendment (the \\\"Third Amendment\\\" and, together with the Waiver and Second Amendment, the \\\"Amendments\\\") to the Original Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendments described below, the \\\"Amended Credit Agreement\\\" or the \\\"Credit Agreement\\\") intended to provide the Company with increased financial flexibility through the third quarter of 2018. The Waiver and Second Amendment, among other things, suspends the quarterly Total Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio covenants set forth in the Original Credit Agreement commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2015 and running through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017. Upon reinstatement of these covenants as of the quarter ending September 30, 2017, the required levels initially will be more permissive than those in effect prior to the Waiver and Second Amendment, and will gradually adjust to those prior levels over the subsequent fiscal quarters.\\n\\nThe Waiver and Second Amendment also provides for new financial covenants that will apply in lieu of the quarterly Total Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio previously in effect, including the following:\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\na quarterly minimum EBITDA covenant, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and running through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, based on a negotiated EBITDA test (\\\"Minimum EBITDA covenant\\\");\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\na collateral coverage covenant (\\\"Collateral Coverage covenant\\\") commencing at the closing of the Waiver and Second Amendment and running through the quarter ending March 31, 2018, which will limit outstanding Revolver borrowings and letters of credit to the greater of (i) $300.0 million and (ii) an amount derived from 80% of Eligible Receivables (as defined in the Waiver and Second Amendment) and 50% of Eligible Inventory (as defined in the Waiver and Second Amendment) (subject to the reduced maximum Revolver borrowing capacity described below); and\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\na quarterly limitation on capital expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2015, and annual limitations on capital expenditures for the four fiscal quarter periods ending December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2017\\n\\nIn summary, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants applicable to the Revolver and the Five-Year Term Loan, which include: (i) a maximum Total Leverage Ratio of 5.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017, 5.00:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017, 4.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018, 4.25:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018 and 4.00:1.00 for each fiscal quarter thereafter; (ii) a minimum quarterly ratio of consolidated EBITDA of C&J and its subsidiaries to consolidated interest expense of C&J and its subsidiaries (\\\"Interest Expense Ratio\\\") of 2.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, 2.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018 and 3.00:1.00 for each fiscal quarter thereafter; and (iii) starting September 30, 2015 and until the fiscal quarter ending June, 30, 2017, a Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA covenant as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n47\\n\\nMinimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA (1)\\n\\nCumulative Cushion Amount\\n\\nThree months ended September 30, 2015\\n\\n$(15,000)\\n\\n$10,000\\n\\nThree months ended December 31, 2015\\n\\n$10,000\\n\\n$20,000\\n\\nSix months ended March 31, 2016\\n\\n$28,000\\n\\n$40,000\\n\\nNine months ended June 30, 2016\\n\\n$63,000\\n\\n$60,000\\n\\nTwelve months ended September 30, 2016\\n\\n$121,000\\n\\n$60,000\\n\\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2016\\n\\n$115,000\\n\\nNone\\n\\nTwelve months ended March 31, 2017\\n\\n$165,000\\n\\nNone\\n\\nTwelve months ended June 30, 2017\\n\\n$205,000\\n\\nNone\\n\\n(1) Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA is defined as total earnings (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), and net gain or loss on disposal of assets, and excludes, among other things, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, and non-routine items.\\n\\nThe Company may use some or all of the \\\"Cumulative Cushion Amount\\\" set forth above to increase the Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA for the specified given period for purposes of satisfying the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA test applicable to such period.  In the event the Company utilizes only some of the Cumulative Cushion Amount for such period, any used amount for such period will reduce the Cumulative Cushion Amount specified for any future period.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of the above-referenced covenant suspension is also subject to certain conditions subsequent that, among other things, will reduce our capacity to make investments and restricted payments through the quarter ending December 31, 2017.\\n\\nPursuant to the Third Amendment, the revolving lenders agreed to replace the existing revolving facility with a new revolving facility having a revised pricing grid that increases the applicable rate on revolving borrowings by (i) 50 basis points in the event that C&J's most recently reported Total Leverage Ratio is greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and less than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0 and (ii) 100 basis points in the event that C&J's most recently reported Total Leverage Ratio is greater than 4.5 to 1.0.\\n\\nIn connection with the Waiver and Second Amendment and the Third Amendment, the Company also reduced maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement from $600.0 million to $400.0 million.\\n\\nThe borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility are C&J, Luxco and CJ Holding Co. The borrower under the Term Loan B Facility is CJ Holding Co. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries.\\n\\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on March 24, 2020 (except that if any Five-Year Term Loans (described below) have not been repaid prior to September 24, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on September 24, 2019). The Term Loan B Facility is comprised of two tranches: a tranche consisting of $572.1 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans as of September 30, 2015 maturing on March 24, 2020 (the \\\"Five-Year Term Loans\\\") and a tranche consisting of a $482.6 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans as of September 30, 2015 maturing on March 24, 2022 (the \\\"Seven-Year Term Loans\\\").Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are non-amortizing. The Term Loan B Facility requires the borrower thereunder to make quarterly amortization payments in an amount equal to 1.0% per annum, with the remaining balance payable on the applicable maturity date.\\n\\nAmounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest based on, at the option of the borrower, the London Interbank Offered Rate (\\\"LIBOR\\\") or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin based on the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness of C&J and its subsidiaries to consolidated EBITDA of C&J and its subsidiaries for the most recent four fiscal quarter period for which financial statements are available (the \\\"Total Leverage Ratio\\\"). The Revolving Credit Facility also requires that the borrowers pay a commitment fee equal to a percentage of unused commitments which varies based on the Total Leverage Ratio.\\n\\nFive-Year Term Loans outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility bear interest based on, at the option of the borrower, LIBOR (which, in the case of the Term Loan B Facility, will be deemed to be no less than 1.0% per annum), plus a margin of 5.5%, or an alternative base rate, plus a margin of 4.5%. Seven-Year Term Loans outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility bear interest based on, at the option of the borrower, LIBOR (which, in the case of the Term Loan B Facility, will be deemed to\\n\\n48\\n\\nbe no less than 1.0% per annum), plus a margin of 6.25%, or an alternative base rate, plus a margin of 5.25%. The Term Loan B Facility also contains 'most favored nation' pricing protection requiring that if the effective yield (giving effect to, among other things, consent fees paid to the lenders) of the Five-Year Term Loans increases by more than 50 basis points, the effective yield of the Seven-Year Term Loans must increase by the same amount less 50 basis points.\\n\\nThe alternative base rate is equal to the highest of (i) the Administrative Agent's prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0%.\\n\\nSubject to certain conditions and limitations, the Credit Agreement permits the borrowers to increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in a total principal amount of up to $100.0 million.\\n\\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is permitted to be prepaid from time to time without premium or penalty. Five-Year Term Loans are subject to a prepayment premium of 4% for any voluntary prepayments made on or prior to March 24, 2016 and no prepayment premium thereafter. Seven-Year Term Loans will be subject to a prepayment premium of 5% for any voluntary prepayments made on or prior to March 24, 2017 and no prepayment premium thereafter.\\n\\nSubject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Term Loan B Facility is required to be prepaid under particular circumstances, including (i) in the event that C&J and its subsidiaries generate Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in any fiscal year, in an amount equal to 50% of the Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year if the Total Leverage Ratio as of the end of such fiscal year is 3.25:1.00 or greater, (ii) in the event of a sale or other disposition of property by C&J or its subsidiaries, in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of such sale or disposition, subject to customary reinvestment rights and other exceptions, and (iii) in the event of an incurrence of debt not permitted under the Credit Agreement, in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of such debt.\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants (in each case, subject to exceptions) that limit, among other things, our ability to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens or indebtedness, sell or otherwise dispose of their assets, make certain restricted payments and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, make capital expenditures and prepay certain indebtedness.  lease see \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of potential risks associated with our financial and restrictive covenant structure.\\n\\nContractual Obligations\\n\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\\n\\nContractual Obligation\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nLess than\\n\\n1 year\\n\\n1-3 years\\n\\n3-5 years\\n\\nMore than\\n\\n5 years\\n\\nRevolving Credit Facility (1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n138,985\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,641\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,263\\n\\n$\\n\\n125,081\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nTerm Loan B Facility (2)\\n\\n1,422,232\\n\\n83,454\\n\\n164,302\\n\\n676,463\\n\\n498,013\\n\\nCapital leases (3)\\n\\n40,060\\n\\n3,734\\n\\n7,269\\n\\n7,672\\n\\n21,385\\n\\nOperating leases\\n\\n27,837\\n\\n9,008\\n\\n8,612\\n\\n4,147\\n\\n6,070\\n\\nInventory and materials (4)\\n\\n102,919\\n\\n33,663\\n\\n62,880\\n\\n6,376\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nService equipment and other capital expenditures\\n\\n2,064\\n\\n2,064\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,734,097\\n\\n$\\n\\n136,564\\n\\n$\\n\\n252,326\\n\\n$\\n\\n819,739\\n\\n$\\n\\n525,468\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncludes estimated interest costs at an interest rate of 2.7% along with related charges.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIncludes estimated interest costs on two term loan tranches at an interest rate of 6.5% and 7.25%.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nCapital lease amounts include $5.2 million in interest payments.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nPrimarily related to sand contract purchase commitments.\\n\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\n\\n49\\n\\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, as of December 31, 2015 .\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\n\\nThe selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting standards have developed. Accounting standards generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve the implementation and interpretation of existing standards, and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. We make every effort to properly comply with all applicable standards on or before their adoption, and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting standards are critical.\\n\\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\\"U.S. GAAP\\\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\n\\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas of management's judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment . Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the related assets, are charged to expense when incurred. Refurbishments are capitalized when the life of the equipment is extended. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operating income. The cost of property and equipment currently in service is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 25 years.\\n\\nPP&E are evaluated on a quarterly basis to identify events or changes in circumstances (\\\"triggering events\\\") that indicate the carrying value of certain PP&E may not be recoverable. PP&E are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of PP&E is not recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets with such cash flows to be realized over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group, excluding interest expense. We determined the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are independent of other asset groups to be at the service line level, which consists of the well services, hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing, wireline, pumpdown, directional drilling, cementing, artificial lift applications, international coiled tubing, equipment manufacturing and repair services, specialty chemicals and data acquisition and control instruments provider service lines as well as the vertically integrated research and technology service line. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for a given asset group is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying value of the related assets. The impairment loss is then allocated across the asset group's major classifications.\\n\\nGoodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill is allocated to our three reporting units: Completion Services, Well Support Services and Other Services, all of which are consistent with the presentation of our three reportable segments. At the reporting unit level, we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 31 of each year, or when events or changes in circumstances, referred to as triggering events, indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable and that a potential impairment exists.\\n\\nJudgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested for impairment more frequently than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, market changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments.\\n\\nBefore employing detailed impairment testing methodologies, we may first evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors relevant to each reporting unit, such as macroeconomic, industry, market or any other factors that have a significant bearing on fair value. If we first utilize a qualitative approach and determine that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, detailed testing methodologies are then applied. Otherwise, we conclude that no impairment has\\n\\n50\\n\\noccurred. Detailed impairment testing, or Step 1 testing, involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step, or Step 2 testing, includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value.\\n\\nOur Step 1 impairment analysis involves the use of a blended income and market approach. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. Critical assumptions include projected revenue growth, fleet count, utilization, gross profit rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and price-to-earnings multiples. Our market capitalization is also used to corroborate reporting unit valuations.\\n\\nSimilar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\\n\\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. These intangibles are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (a triggering event) indicate that the asset may have a net book value in excess of recoverable value. In these cases, we perform a recoverability test on its definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset for recoverability. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment does not exist and a loss will not be recognized. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is not recoverable and the amount of impairment must be determined by fair valuing the asset.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions . In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as trade names and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\\n\\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analysis. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have an impact on our net earnings.\\n\\nSee \\\"Note 10 \\u2013 Mergers and Acquisitions\\\" in Item 8 \\\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the acquisition-related information associated with mergers and acquisitions completed in the last three fiscal years.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition .

Bad debt expense of $8.1 million , $0.7 million and $0.7 million was included in direct costs on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.\\n\\nShare-Based Compensation. Our share-based compensation consists of restricted shares and nonqualified share options. We recognize share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We value restricted share grants based on the closing price of our common shares on the NYSE on the grant date, and we value option grants based on the grant date fair value by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of highly subjective assumptions.\\n\\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the expected term of the grant, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate. Further, the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation that we are required to record as an expense. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term, volatility and forfeiture rate related to our share-based compensation on a prospective basis and will incorporate these factors into our option-pricing model. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant management judgment. If, in the future, we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term, the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility and longer expected terms generally result in an increase to share-based compensation expense determined at the date of grant.\\n\\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of our annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when we recognize income tax expenses and benefits.\\n\\nWe account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying\\n\\n53\\n\\namounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.\\n\\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In assessing the likelihood and extent that deferred tax assets will be realized, consideration is given to projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\\n\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. We reverse a previously recognized tax position in the first period in which it is no longer more-likely-than-not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination. We will record income tax related interest and penalties, if applicable, as a component of the provision for income tax expense.\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\\"FASB\\\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\\\"ASU\\\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\\\"ASU 2014-09\\\"), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 201 5, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\\\"ASU 2015-14\\\") , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year and is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.  ASU 2015-14 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method nor has the effect of the standard on ongoing financial reporting been determined.\\n\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (\\\"ASU 2015-03\\\"). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For public entities, ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. ASU 2015-03 is to be applied on a retrospective basis and represents a change in accounting principle. In addition, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (\\\"ASU 2015-15\\\").  ASU 2015-15 clarifies the guidance in ASU 2015-03 regarding presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The SEC Staff announced they would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  We do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, S implifying the Measurement of Inventory (\\\"ASU 2015-11\\\"), which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is part of the FASB's simplification initiative and applies to entities that measure inventory using a method other than last-in, first-out (\\\"LIFO\\\") or the retail inventory method. The guidance will require prospective application at the beginning of the Company's first q uarter of fiscal 2018, but permits adoption in an earlier period.  We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position.\\n\\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (\\\"ASU 2015-16\\\"). ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer must record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  ASU 2015-16 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position.\\n\\n54\\n\\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\\\"ASU 2015-17\\\"). ASU 2015-17 amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet. The Company is required to adopt this ASU for years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted, and the guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nInflation\\n\\nInflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the U.S. economy, and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of our equipment, materials and supplies as increasing oil and natural gas prices increase activity in our areas of operations .\\n\\n55\",\n          \"Item 7.\\n\\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\n\\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\nWhen used in this report the words or phrases \\\"may,\\\" \\\"could,\\\" \\\"should,\\\" \\\"hope,\\\" \\\"might,\\\" \\\"believe,\\\" \\\"expect,\\\" \\\"plan,\\\" \\\"assume,\\\" \\\"intend,\\\" \\\"estimate,\\\" \\\"anticipate,\\\" \\\"project,\\\" \\\"likely,\\\" or similar expressions are intended to identify \\\"forward-looking statements.\\\" Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including among other things:\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nCompetitive pressures among depository and other financial institutions nationally and in our markets.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nAdverse changes in the economy or business conditions, either nationally or in our markets.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nIncreases in defaults by borrowers and other delinquencies.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOur ability to manage growth effectively, including the successful expansion of our client support, administrative infrastructure and internal management systems.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nFluctuations in interest rates and market prices.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nThe consequences of continued bank acquisitions and mergers in our markets, resulting in fewer but much larger and financially stronger competitors.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nChanges in legislative or regulatory requirements applicable to us and our subsidiaries.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nChanges in tax requirements, including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, including with respect to our internet banking activities.\\n\\nThese risks, together with the risks identified in Item 1A \\u2014 Risk Factors, could cause actual results to differ materially from what we have anticipated or projected.

All of our operations are conducted through the Banks and certain subsidiaries of FBB. We operate as a business bank focusing on delivering a full line of commercial banking products and services tailored to meet the specific needs of small and medium sized businesses, business owners, executives, professionals and high net worth individuals. Our products and services include commercial lending, SBA lending and servicing, asset-based lending, equipment financing, factoring, trust and investment services, treasury management services and a broad range of deposit products. We do not utilize a branch network to attract retail clients. Our operating philosophy is focused on local decision-making and local client service from each of our primary banking locations in Madison, Brookfield and Appleton, Wisconsin and Leawood, Kansas combined with the efficiency of centralized administrative functions such as support for information technology, loan and deposit operations, finance and accounting and human resources. We believe we have a niche business banking model and we consistently operate within our model. This allows our experienced staff to provide the financial expertise necessary for our clients to be successful on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nOur success depends on our ability to execute our strategic plan. In 2015, our strategic initiatives included, but were not limited to:\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nMaintaining asset quality while organically growing our loan and lease portfolio.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nIncreasing the number and volume of transaction accounts.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nIncreasing fee revenue associated with treasury management services, growing trust and investment services and growing SBA lending.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nInvesting in technology to support our strategic initiatives, thereby maintaining our efficient operating model.\\n\\nWe have achieved success on nearly all points of this strategic plan by posting record top line revenue, continuing to grow the loan and lease portfolio, and maintaining our overall operating efficiency, resulting in record net income. Despite an increase in non-performing assets in 2015, we believe our strong underwriting and workout strategies will continue to benefit asset quality metrics, limiting our exposure to subsequent charge-offs.\\n\\nOur 2016 strategies include, but are not limited to:\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nContinuing our trend of historically low levels of charge-offs by maintaining our consistent credit culture.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nIntently focusing on organically growing our loan and lease portfolio.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nIncreasing the number and volume of transaction accounts to support our efforts to increase fee revenue associated with treasury management services and to maintain our targeted operating range of in-market deposits to total deposits.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nExpanding our unique SBA strategy across the First Business franchise.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nMaintaining our efficient operating model while continuing to make timely investments in people and technology to keep pace with our strategic growth trajectory.\\n\\nWe believe these strategies will continue to create opportunities to capitalize on economic expansion as well as any disruption to our competitors' businesses in our primary Wisconsin and Kansas City markets. In addition to organic growth, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate possible acquisitions that would enhance our franchise and allow us to efficiently and profitably deploy capital.\\n\\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOur total assets increased to $1.783 billion as of December 31, 2015 , a 9.4% increase from $1.629 billion at December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a record $16.5 million , 16.8% higher than the previous record of $14.1 million earned for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nDiluted earnings per common share were $1.90 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.75 earned in the prior year.\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nNet interest margin was 3.66% for the year ended December 31, 2015 , improving 10 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nTop line revenue, which consists of net interest income and non-interest income, of $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased 34.5% compared to $56.2 million for the same period in 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nReturn on average assets and return on average equity for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 0.97% and 11.36% respectively, compared to 1.04% and 11.78% for 2014 .\\n\\n33\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe recorded a $3.4 million provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nNet loans and leases at December 31, 2015 increased $150.9 million , or 11.9% , to $1.417 billion from $1.266 billion as of December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nNon-performing assets were $24.0 million and 1.34% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 compared to $11.5 million and 0.70% of total assets as of December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nNet charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.10% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nTrust and investment services fee income increased by $520,000 , or 11.7% , to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nAverage in-market deposits of $1.047 billion , or 69.9% of total deposits, for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased 32.2% , compared to $791.8 million , or 65.5% of total deposits, for the same period in 2014 .\\n\\n34\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nResults of Operations\\n\\nAlterra Bank\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Alterra contributed $12.6 million in net interest income, including $2.5 million related to the net accretion/amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, $6.1 million in non-interest income, $10 million in non-interest expense and $2.8 million in loan loss provision, netting to a total of $5.9 million in pre-tax income to our results. For the year ended December 31, 2014, which included two months' contribution from Alterra, Alterra contributed $2.0 million in net interest income, including $392,000 related to the net accretion/amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, $567,000 in non-interest income, $1.5 million in non-interest expense and $337,000 in loan loss provision, netting to a total of $638,000 in pre-tax income to our results.\\n\\nTop Line Revenue\\n\\nTop line revenue is comprised of net interest income and non-interest income. This measurement is also commonly referred to as operating revenue. In 2015 , top line revenue increased by approximately 34.5% from the prior year primarily due to a full year's contribution from Alterra.\\n\\nTop line revenue, including two months' contribution from Alterra, increased 11.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an 11.6% increase in average loans and leases and a two basis point increase in net interest margin. Further, non-interest income benefited from the introduction of gains on the sale of SBA loans, as well as an 18.1% increase in trust and investment services fee income. The components of top line revenue were as follows:\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nChange\\n\\n(Dollars In Thousands)\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\n$\\n\\n58,640\\n\\n$\\n\\n46,130\\n\\n27.1\\n\\n%\\n\\nNon-interest income\\n\\n17,011\\n\\n10,103\\n\\n68.4\\n\\nTop line revenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n75,651\\n\\n$\\n\\n56,233\\n\\n34.5\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nChange\\n\\n(Dollars In Thousands)\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\n$\\n\\n46,130\\n\\n$\\n\\n42,105\\n\\n9.6\\n\\n%\\n\\nNon-interest income\\n\\n10,103\\n\\n8,442\\n\\n19.7\\n\\nTop line revenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n56,233\\n\\n$\\n\\n50,547\\n\\n11.2\\n\\nReturn on Average Assets and Return on Average Equity\\n\\nReturn on average assets (\\\"ROAA\\\") was 0.97% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.04% for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The decrease in ROAA can be attributed to average asset growth exceeding net income growth. Total average assets increased 24.7% in 2015 compared to 2014 , while net income increased 16.8% during the same time period. The increase in net income was principally due to improved net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and by an increase in non-interest expense to support strategic investments in talent and technology. We believe this recent decrease in operating leverage was necessary in the short-term in order to build a scalable franchise that can accommodate our growth trajectory going forward. ROAA is a critical metric used by us to measure the profitability of our organization and how efficiently our assets are deployed.  ROAA also allows us to better benchmark our profitability to our peers without the need to consider different degrees of leverage which can ultimately influence return on equity measures.\\n\\nReturn on average equity (\\\"ROAE\\\") for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 11.36% compared to 11.78% for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The primary reasons for the decrease in ROAE are consistent with the net income variance explanations discussed above. In addition, we had a larger average equity base in 2015 compared to 2014 principally due to the acquisition of Alterra on November 1, 2014 and the corresponding issuance of 720,162 shares of common stock on a post-split basis as a portion of consideration paid in the transaction. We view ROAE as an important measurement for monitoring profitability, and continue to focus on improving our return to our shareholders by enhancing the overall profitability of our client relationships, controlling our expenses and minimizing our costs of credit.\\n\\n35\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nEfficiency Ratio\\n\\nEfficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure representing non-interest expense excluding the effects of losses or gains on foreclosed properties, amortization of other intangible assets and other discrete items, if any, divided by top line revenue.  We believe the efficiency ratio allows investors and analysts to better assess the Corporation's operating expenses in relation to its top line revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain non-recurring and other discrete items. The efficiency ratio also allows management to benchmark performance of our model to our peers without the influence of the loan loss provision and tax considerations, which will ultimately influence other traditional financial measurements, including ROAA and ROAE. The information provided below reconciles the efficiency ratio to its most comparable GAAP measure.\\n\\nPlease refer to the Non-Interest Expense section below for discussion on the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in the efficiency ratio.\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nChange\\n\\n(Dollars in Thousands)\\n\\nTotal non-interest expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n47,374\\n\\n$\\n\\n33,775\\n\\n40.3\\n\\n%\\n\\nLess:\\n\\nNet gain on foreclosed properties\\n\\n(171\\n\\n)\\n\\n(10\\n\\n)\\n\\nNM\\n\\nAmortization of other intangible assets\\n\\n71\\n\\n12\\n\\nNM\\n\\nTotal adjusted operating expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n47,474\\n\\n$\\n\\n33,773\\n\\n40.6\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\n$\\n\\n58,640\\n\\n$\\n\\n46,130\\n\\n27.1\\n\\nTotal non-interest income\\n\\n17,011\\n\\n10,103\\n\\n68.4\\n\\nTop line revenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n75,651\\n\\n$\\n\\n56,233\\n\\n34.5\\n\\nEfficiency ratio\\n\\n62.75\\n\\n%\\n\\n60.06\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.7\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nChange\\n\\n(Dollars in Thousands)\\n\\nTotal non-interest expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n33,775\\n\\n$\\n\\n30,371\\n\\n11.2\\n\\n%\\n\\nLess:\\n\\nNet gain on foreclosed properties\\n\\n(10\\n\\n)\\n\\n(117\\n\\n)\\n\\nNM\\n\\nAmortization of other intangible assets\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nNM\\n\\nEndowment to First Business Charitable Foundation\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n1,300\\n\\nNM\\n\\nTotal adjusted operating expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n33,773\\n\\n$\\n\\n29,188\\n\\n15.7\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\n$\\n\\n46,130\\n\\n$\\n\\n42,105\\n\\n9.6\\n\\nTotal non-interest income\\n\\n10,103\\n\\n8,442\\n\\n19.7\\n\\nTop line revenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n56,233\\n\\n$\\n\\n50,547\\n\\n11.2\\n\\nEfficiency ratio\\n\\n60.06\\n\\n%\\n\\n57.74\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nNM = Not meaningful\\n\\nNet Interest Income\\n\\nNet interest income levels depend on the amounts of and yields on interest-earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and the asset/liability management processes to prepare for and respond to such changes. The table below shows our average balances, interest, average rates, net interest margin and the spread between combined average rates earned on our interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. The average balances are derived from average daily balances and were affected in 2014 by the November 1, 2014 closing of the Alterra acquisition.\\n\\n36\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nbalance\\n\\nInterest\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nyield/\\n\\ncost\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nbalance\\n\\nInterest\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nyield/\\n\\ncost\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nbalance\\n\\nInterest\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nyield/\\n\\ncost\\n\\n(Dollars In Thousands)\\n\\nInterest-earning assets\\n\\nCommercial real estate and other mortgage loans (1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n848,213\\n\\n$\\n\\n40,006\\n\\n4.72\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n665,213\\n\\n$\\n\\n32,066\\n\\n4.82\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n633,605\\n\\n$\\n\\n32,021\\n\\n5.05\\n\\n%\\n\\nCommercial and industrial loans (1)\\n\\n445,659\\n\\n26,668\\n\\n5.98\\n\\n%\\n\\n332,591\\n\\n19,962\\n\\n6.00\\n\\n%\\n\\n268,376\\n\\n16,739\\n\\n6.24\\n\\n%\\n\\nDirect financing leases (1)\\n\\n30,228\\n\\n1,394\\n\\n4.61\\n\\n%\\n\\n29,395\\n\\n1,367\\n\\n4.65\\n\\n%\\n\\n17,413\\n\\n844\\n\\n4.85\\n\\n%\\n\\nConsumer and other loans (1)\\n\\n23,996\\n\\n1,067\\n\\n4.45\\n\\n%\\n\\n16,862\\n\\n652\\n\\n3.87\\n\\n%\\n\\n16,446\\n\\n634\\n\\n3.86\\n\\n%\\n\\nTotal loans and leases receivable (1)\\n\\n1,348,096\\n\\n69,135\\n\\n5.13\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,044,061\\n\\n54,047\\n\\n5.18\\n\\n%\\n\\n935,840\\n\\n50,238\\n\\n5.37\\n\\n%\\n\\nMortgage-related securities (2)\\n\\n153,182\\n\\n2,490\\n\\n1.63\\n\\n%\\n\\n156,144\\n\\n2,894\\n\\n1.85\\n\\n%\\n\\n159,188\\n\\n2,841\\n\\n1.78\\n\\n%\\n\\nOther investment securities (3)\\n\\n29,686\\n\\n472\\n\\n1.59\\n\\n%\\n\\n28,458\\n\\n448\\n\\n1.57\\n\\n%\\n\\n33,990\\n\\n474\\n\\n1.39\\n\\n%\\n\\nFHLB and FRB stock\\n\\n2,886\\n\\n81\\n\\n2.82\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,512\\n\\n14\\n\\n0.94\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,402\\n\\n4\\n\\n0.29\\n\\n%\\n\\nShort-term investments\\n\\n69,264\\n\\n293\\n\\n0.42\\n\\n%\\n\\n67,281\\n\\n298\\n\\n0.44\\n\\n%\\n\\n59,737\\n\\n253\\n\\n0.42\\n\\n%\\n\\nTotal interest-earning assets\\n\\n1,603,114\\n\\n72,471\\n\\n4.52\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,297,456\\n\\n57,701\\n\\n4.45\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,190,157\\n\\n53,810\\n\\n4.52\\n\\n%\\n\\nNon-interest-earning assets\\n\\n98,781\\n\\n67,507\\n\\n58,536\\n\\nTotal assets\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,701,895\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,364,963\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,248,693\\n\\nInterest-bearing liabilities\\n\\nTransaction accounts\\n\\n$\\n\\n125,558\\n\\n297\\n\\n0.24\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n83,508\\n\\n185\\n\\n0.22\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n62,578\\n\\n126\\n\\n0.20\\n\\n%\\n\\nMoney market\\n\\n602,842\\n\\n3,331\\n\\n0.55\\n\\n%\\n\\n493,322\\n\\n2,553\\n\\n0.52\\n\\n%\\n\\n450,558\\n\\n2,398\\n\\n0.53\\n\\n%\\n\\nCertificates of deposit\\n\\n106,177\\n\\n825\\n\\n0.78\\n\\n%\\n\\n60,284\\n\\n536\\n\\n0.89\\n\\n%\\n\\n60,276\\n\\n611\\n\\n1.01\\n\\n%\\n\\nWholesale deposits\\n\\n450,460\\n\\n6,424\\n\\n1.43\\n\\n%\\n\\n416,202\\n\\n6,196\\n\\n1.49\\n\\n%\\n\\n393,726\\n\\n6,604\\n\\n1.68\\n\\n%\\n\\nTotal interest-bearing deposits\\n\\n1,285,037\\n\\n10,877\\n\\n0.85\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,053,316\\n\\n9,470\\n\\n0.90\\n\\n%\\n\\n967,138\\n\\n9,739\\n\\n1.01\\n\\n%\\n\\nFHLB advances\\n\\n14,779\\n\\n110\\n\\n0.75\\n\\n%\\n\\n5,017\\n\\n22\\n\\n0.45\\n\\n%\\n\\n6,471\\n\\n13\\n\\n0.19\\n\\n%\\n\\nOther borrowings\\n\\n25,460\\n\\n1,732\\n\\n6.80\\n\\n%\\n\\n13,688\\n\\n967\\n\\n7.06\\n\\n%\\n\\n12,196\\n\\n842\\n\\n6.90\\n\\n%\\n\\nJunior subordinated notes\\n\\n10,315\\n\\n1,112\\n\\n10.78\\n\\n%\\n\\n10,315\\n\\n1,112\\n\\n10.78\\n\\n%\\n\\n10,315\\n\\n1,111\\n\\n10.78\\n\\n%\\n\\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\\n\\n1,335,591\\n\\n13,831\\n\\n1.04\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,082,336\\n\\n11,571\\n\\n1.07\\n\\n%\\n\\n996,120\\n\\n11,705\\n\\n1.18\\n\\n%\\n\\nNon-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts\\n\\n211,945\\n\\n154,687\\n\\n138,920\\n\\nOther non-interest-bearing liabilities\\n\\n9,049\\n\\n7,918\\n\\n8,909\\n\\nTotal liabilities\\n\\n1,556,585\\n\\n1,244,941\\n\\n1,143,949\\n\\nStockholders' equity\\n\\n145,310\\n\\n120,022\\n\\n104,744\\n\\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,701,895\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,364,963\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,248,693\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\n$\\n\\n58,640\\n\\n$\\n\\n46,130\\n\\n$\\n\\n42,105\\n\\nNet interest spread\\n\\n3.48\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.38\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.34\\n\\n%\\n\\nNet interest-earning assets\\n\\n$\\n\\n267,523\\n\\n$\\n\\n215,120\\n\\n$\\n\\n194,037\\n\\nNet interest margin\\n\\n3.66\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.56\\n\\n%\\n\\n3.54\\n\\n%\\n\\nAverage interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities\\n\\n120.03\\n\\n%\\n\\n119.88\\n\\n%\\n\\n119.48\\n\\n%\\n\\nReturn on average assets\\n\\n0.97\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.04\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.10\\n\\n%\\n\\nReturn on average equity\\n\\n11.36\\n\\n%\\n\\n11.78\\n\\n%\\n\\n13.12\\n\\n%\\n\\nAverage equity to average assets\\n\\n8.54\\n\\n%\\n\\n8.79\\n\\n%\\n\\n8.39\\n\\n%\\n\\nNon-interest expense to average assets\\n\\n2.78\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.47\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.43\\n\\n%\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe average balances of loans and leases include non-performing loans and leases.

The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to a favorable volume variances in total loans and leases receivable combined with a 10 basis point increase in net interest margin.\\n\\nThe yield on average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 4.52% compared to 4.45% for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The increase in the yield on average earning assets was principally due to the accretion of $1.8 million of purchase accounting adjustments. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion in both years, the yield on average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 4.41% compared to 4.42% for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Similarly, excluding net accretion, the yield on the loan and lease portfolio declined 14 basis points to 5.00% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 5.14% for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\n38\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nA significant portion of our loan and lease portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans with terms generally from three to five years. As these loans reach their maturity they are renewed at current market rates, which are generally lower than the original rate of the loan, and subject to competitive pricing pressures. As a result, the overall yield on the loan and lease portfolio, excluding purchase accounting adjustments, continued to decline in 2015. Prepayment activity and the associated fees collected in lieu of interest partially offset the decline in yields.\\n\\nThe overall weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015 , a decrease of 3 basis points from 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The decrease in the overall rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily caused by a decrease in rate paid on our wholesale deposits as well as our in-market certificates of deposit. The continued low rate environment combined with the maturity structure of our wholesale certificates of deposit provided us the opportunity to be able to manage our liability structure in both maturity terms and rate to deliver a similar net interest margin during 2015 relative to 2014. Further, our continued success of attracting in-market non-interest bearing demand deposits through new business relationships and increased client deposit balances contributed to the overall decline in our cost of funds. This decrease was partially offset by an unfavorable rate and volume variance on money market accounts and by the addition of other borrowings resulting from the $15.0 million of subordinated debt issued on August 26, 2014 and $9.0 million of FHLB advances assumed in the Alterra acquisition, both at rates that are significantly higher than our average cost of funds. Average in-market deposits - comprised of all transaction accounts, money market accounts, and non-wholesale deposits - increased 32.2% to $1.047 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $791.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\nNet interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.66% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.56% for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Net accretion/amortization on the Alterra purchase accounting adjustments of $2.5 million combined with the addition of the Alterra loan portfolio at yields greater than that of the Wisconsin-based portfolio drove a favorable impact of 15 basis points in net interest margin. While management expects the net accretion/amortization of the purchase accounting adjustments to trend lower, it may be volatile due to the uncertain nature of loan prepayments. In addition, the changing mix of our deposit base reduced our overall cost of funds and positively affected our net interest margin by approximately five basis points, offsetting the seven basis point decrease related to the declining yield on our investment portfolio. Other factors, primarily the aforementioned issuance of $15.0 million of subordinated debt on August 26, 2014, negatively influenced the net interest margin by three basis points in the aggregate.\\n\\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\\n\\nWe recorded a provision for loan and lease losses in the amount of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and a negative provision for loan and lease losses of $959,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 . We determine our provision for loan and lease losses based upon credit risk and other subjective factors pursuant to our allowance for loan and lease loss methodology, the magnitude of current and historical net charge-offs recorded in the period and the amount of reserves established for impaired loans that present collateral shortfall positions. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the methodology used to determine the amount of loan and lease loss provision was refined by increasing the look-back period from three years to eight years, estimating the loss emergence period using a more granular approach, and placing more emphasis on the inherent risk of the loan and lease portfolio and less emphasis on subjective analysis. The impact of these refinements was not significant. Refer to Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for further information regarding our refined allowance for loan and lease loss methodology.\\n\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the factors influencing the provision for loan and lease losses were the following:\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nChanges in the provision for loan and lease losses associated with:\\n\\nAddition (release) of specific reserves on impaired loans, net\\n\\n$\\n\\n908\\n\\n$\\n\\n(19\\n\\n)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(381\\n\\n)\\n\\nNet decrease in allowance for loan and lease loss reserve due to subjective factor changes (including impact of 2015 methodology change)\\n\\n(352\\n\\n)\\n\\n(878\\n\\n)\\n\\n(492\\n\\n)\\n\\nCharge-offs in excess of specific reserves\\n\\n1,332\\n\\n1,233\\n\\n180\\n\\nRecoveries\\n\\n(114\\n\\n)\\n\\n(425\\n\\n)\\n\\n(374\\n\\n)\\n\\nChange in inherent risk of the loan and lease portfolio\\n\\n1,612\\n\\n1,325\\n\\n108\\n\\nTotal provision for loan and lease losses\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,386\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,236\\n\\n$\\n\\n(959\\n\\n)\\n\\n39\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThe addition (release) of specific reserves on impaired loans represents new specific reserves established on impaired loans for which, although collateral shortfalls are present, we believe we will be able to recover our principal and/or it represents the release of previously established reserves that are no longer required. A decrease in allowance for loan and lease losses due to subjective factor changes reflects management's evaluation of the level of risk within the portfolio based upon several factors for each portfolio category, including but not limited to: management's ongoing review and grading of the loan and lease portfolios, consideration of delinquency experience, changes in the size of the loan and lease portfolios, existing economic conditions, level of loans and leases subject to more frequent review by management, changes in underlying collateral, concentrations of loans to specific industries, and other qualitative factors that could affect credit losses. As overall asset quality metrics improve and the level and trend of the factors improve for a sustainable period of time, the level of general reserve due to these factors may be reduced causing an overall reduction in the level of the required reserve deemed to be appropriate by management. Conversely, increases in the level and trend of these factors may warrant an increase to our overall allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs in excess of specific reserves represent an additional provision for loan and lease losses required to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level deemed appropriate by management. This amount is net of the release of any specific reserve that may have already been provided. Charge-offs in excess of specific reserves can occur in situations where: (i) a loan has previously been partially written down to its estimated fair value and continues to decline, (ii) rapid deterioration of a credit requires an immediate partial or full charge-off, or (iii) the specific reserve was not adequate to cover the amount of the required charge-off. Change in the inherent risk of the portfolio is primarily influenced by the overall growth in gross loans and leases and a migration analysis of the loans previously charged off, as well as, movement of existing loans and leases in and out of an impaired loan classification where a specific evaluation of a particular credit may be required rather than the application of a general reserve ratio. Refer to Asset Quality for further information regarding the overall credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio.\\n\\nNon-Interest Income\\n\\nNon-interest income, consisting primarily of fees earned for trust and investment services, gains on sale of SBA and residential mortgage loans, service charges on deposits and loan fee income, increased by $6.9 million , or 68.4% , to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , from $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which included only two months' contribution from Alterra. Management continues to focus on revenue growth from non-interest income sources in order to maintain a diversified revenue stream through greater contribution from fee-based revenues. As a result, total non-interest income accounted for 22.5% of our total revenues in 2015 compared to 18.0% in 2014.\\n\\nTrust and investment services fee income increased by $520,000 , or 11.7% , to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Trust and investment services fee income is primarily driven by the amount of assets under management and administration as well as the mix of business at different fee structures and can be positively or negatively influenced by the timing and magnitude of volatility within the capital markets. At December 31, 2015 , our trust assets under management were $817.9 million , or 5.8% more than the trust assets under management of $773.2 million at December 31, 2014 , while our assets under administration increased approximately 8.9% , to $203.2 million at December 31, 2015 from $186.5 million at December 31, 2014 . We expect to continue to increase our revenue from assets under management and administration, but market volatility may also affect the actual change in revenue.\\n\\nGain on sale of SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $4.0 million , an increase of $3.7 million from the same period in 2014 , attributable to growth in our Kansas City market, successful expansion of our SBA lending platform into our Wisconsin markets and a full year's contribution from Alterra.\\n\\nService charges on deposits increased by $343,000 , or 13.9% , to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The increase in service charges on deposits is primarily due to a full year's contribution from Alterra combined with an increase in transaction accounts in our Wisconsin markets.\\n\\nLoan fees increased by approximately $610,000 , or 38.7% , to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The increase in loan fees is primarily attributable to a full year's contribution from Alterra, specifically the fee income generated from servicing and packaging SBA loans. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in fees earned for issuing letters of credit on behalf of our clients.\\n\\nGain on sale of residential mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $729,000 , an increase of $655,000 from the same period in 2014 , entirely attributable to a full year's contribution from Alterra.\\n\\n40\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nOther non-interest income increased by $1.0 million to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to $369,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The increase in other income was primarily due to gains recognized on the termination of leased assets, income recognized from our investment in various Community Development Entities and the amortization of the reserve for unfunded commitments resulting from the fair value purchase accounting adjustments associated with the acquisition of Alterra. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we have recognized $458,000 in non-interest income due to the amortization of the reserve as the associated loans have fully funded, renewed or matured. The remaining reserve for unfunded commitments was $39,000 as of December 31, 2015 . Should the commitment be withdrawn for any reason or become fully funded prior to maturity, we will accelerate the remaining liability accordingly.\\n\\nNon-Interest Expense\\n\\nNon-interest expense increased by $13.6 million , or 40.3% , to $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $33.8 million for the comparable period of 2014 . The acquisition of Alterra was the primary driver for the increase in all non-interest expense categories. Compensation, professional fees and marketing expense categories comprise the majority of the overall increase.\\n\\nCompensation expense increased by $7.1 million , or 32.9% , to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . In addition to the increase related to a full year's contribution from Alterra, the overall increase reflects growth in compensation costs related to annual merit increases, employee benefit costs, incentive compensation accruals on a larger base of employees and our strategic investment in new employees to meet our existing and future growth objectives. Full time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2015 were 242 , up 12.6% from 215 at December 31, 2014 . We expect to continue investing in talent to support our strategic growth efforts, both in the form of additional business development and operational staff.\\n\\nProfessional fees expense increased by $1.5 million , or 43.7% , to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . In addition to the increase related to a full year's contribution from Alterra, the overall increase primarily reflects our ongoing strategy to invest in technology-based corporate initiatives to drive operational efficiency. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , professional fees specifically related to information technology (\\\"IT\\\") projects increased $922,000 . In addition, fees paid to other outside service providers increased $536,000 primarily due to temp-to-hire employees required to support our strategic IT initiatives, while fees paid for audit assurance and tax compliance increased by $356,000 . The largest remaining item in the variance was an increase in recruiting expenses related to our ongoing investment in attracting talent, offset by a decrease in merger-related costs of $879,000 .\\n\\nMarketing expense increased by $923,000 , or 55.5% , to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The addition of Alterra and related expansion of our marketing efforts into new geographic regions was the primary driver for the increase.\\n\\nOther non-interest expense increased by $2.1 million , or 88.7% , to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 million for the same time period of 2014 . In addition to the increase related to a full year's contribution from Alterra, the overall increase primarily reflects annual subscriptions for cloud-based solutions and expanded and enhanced telecommunication services to support our growth and ongoing strategy to invest in technology-based corporate initiatives to drive operational efficiency.\\n\\n41\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nIncome tax expense was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher pre-tax income.  The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 33.7% compared to 33.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested in a federal new market tax credit. These credits are typically purchased at 70-90% of the amount of the credit and are generally utilized to offset taxes payable over ten-year and seven-year periods, respectively. For both years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the tax credit used to reduce our tax expense totaled $375,000. The net result of this transaction was a decrease to income tax expense, which reduced our effective tax rate.\\n\\nThe effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory corporate tax rate as follows:\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nStatutory federal tax rate\\n\\n34.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n34.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n34.4\\n\\n%\\n\\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\\n\\n3.9\\n\\n4.7\\n\\n4.6\\n\\nBank owned life insurance\\n\\n(1.3\\n\\n)\\n\\n(1.4\\n\\n)\\n\\n(1.4\\n\\n)\\n\\nTax-exempt security and loan income, net of TEFRA adjustments\\n\\n(3.5\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.5\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.2\\n\\n)\\n\\nFederal new market tax credit\\n\\n(1.0\\n\\n)\\n\\n(1.8\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nNon-deductible transaction costs\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nDiscrete items\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n(0.2\\n\\n)\\n\\n0.1\\n\\nOther\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n33.7\\n\\n%\\n\\n33.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n35.0\\n\\n%\\n\\nThe Corporation's effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Corporation's utilization of federal new market tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans.\\n\\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\nAt December 31, 2015 our total assets were $1.783 billion , an increase of $153.5 million , or 9.4% , from $1.629 billion at December 31, 2014 . The increase in total assets was primarily driven by growth in our loan and lease portfolio.\\n\\nShort-term investments\\n\\nShort-term investments increased by $10.6 million to $98.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $88.4 million at December 31, 2014 . Our short-term investments primarily consist of interest-bearing deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank (\\\"FRB\\\"), which increased by $14.4 million to $84.9 million at December 31, 2015 . We value the safety and soundness provided by the FRB, and therefore we incorporate short-term investments in our on-balance-sheet liquidity program. In general, the level of our short-term investments is influenced by the timing of deposit gathering, scheduled maturities of wholesale deposits, funding of loan and lease growth when opportunities are presented, and the level of our securities portfolio. Although the majority of our short-term investments consist of deposits with the FRB, we also make investments in commercial paper and FDIC insured certificates of deposit acquired through brokers. We approach our decisions to purchase commercial paper with similar rigor and underwriting standards applied to our loan and lease portfolio. The original maturities of the commercial paper are typically sixty days or less and provide an attractive yield in comparison to other short-term alternatives. These investments also assist us in maintaining a shorter duration of our overall investment portfolio which we believe is necessary to take advantage of an anticipated rising rate environment.  Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion.\\n\\nSecurities\\n\\nTotal securities, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, decreased by $8.4 million to $177.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $186.3 million at December 31, 2014 .  As of December 31, 2015 , our total securities portfolio, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, had a weighted average estimated maturity of approximately 2.94 years. Our\\n\\n42\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\ninvestment portfolio primarily consists of collateralized mortgage obligations and agency obligations and is used to provide a source of liquidity, including the ability to pledge securities for possible future cash advances, while contributing to the earnings potential of the Banks. The overall duration of the securities portfolio is established and maintained to further mitigate interest rate risk present within our balance sheet as identified through our asset/liability simulations. We purchase investment securities intended to protect our net interest margin while maintaining an acceptable risk profile. In addition, we will purchase investments to utilize our cash position effectively within appropriate policy guidelines and estimates of future cash demands. While collateralized mortgage obligations present prepayment risk and extension risk, we believe the overall credit risk associated with these investments is minimal, as the majority of the obligations we hold are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (\\\"GNMA\\\"), a U.S. government agency. The estimated repayment streams associated with this portfolio also allow us to better match our short-term liabilities. The Banks' investment policies allow for various types of investments, including tax-exempt municipal securities. The ability to invest in tax-exempt municipal securities provides for further opportunity to improve our overall yield on our securities portfolio. We evaluate the credit risk of the municipal obligations prior to purchase and generally limit our exposure to general obligation issuances from municipalities, primarily in Wisconsin.\\n\\nAs we evaluate the level of on-balance-sheet liquidity, we continue to purchase U.S. Government agency obligations, primarily those obligations issued by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\\\"FHLMC\\\") and Federal National Mortgage Association (\\\"FNMA\\\"). We have structured these purchases to have final maturities within two to four years from the issue date. Some of the securities contain either quarterly or one-time call features. The maturity structure of our securities portfolio allows us to effectively manage the cash flows of these securities along with the collateralized mortgage obligations to be able to meet loan demand in the near future without the need to immediately borrow funds from our various funding sources and proactively adjust the portfolio should interest rates rise within the next two to four years. Our management deems these securities to be creditworthy and believes they exhibit appropriate market yields for the risks assumed. We expect to continue to purchase these types of approved securities with appropriate maturity terms when they are available in the market.\\n\\nThe majority of the securities we hold have active trading markets; therefore, we have not experienced difficulties in pricing our securities. We use a third-party pricing service as our primary source of market prices for our securities portfolio.  On a quarterly basis, we validate the reasonableness of prices received from this source through independent verification of a representative sample of the portfolio, data integrity validation through comparison of current price to prior period prices, and an expectation-based analysis of movement in prices based upon the changes in the related yield curves and other market factors. On a periodic basis, we review the third-party pricing vendor's methodology for pricing relevant securities and the results of its internal control assessments. Our securities portfolio is sensitive to fluctuations in the interest rate environment and has limited sensitivity to credit risk due to the nature of the issuers and guarantors of our securities as previously discussed. If interest rates decline and the credit quality of the securities remains constant or improves, the fair value of our debt securities portfolio would likely improve, thereby increasing our total comprehensive income. If interest rates increase and the credit quality of the securities remains constant or deteriorates, the fair value of our debt securities portfolio would likely decline and therefore decrease our total comprehensive income.  The magnitude of the fair value change will be based upon the duration of the portfolio. A securities portfolio with a longer average duration will exhibit greater market price volatility movements than a securities portfolio with a shorter average duration in a changing rate environment. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recognized unrealized holding losses of $719,000 before income taxes through other comprehensive income. These losses were the result of the increase in longer term interest rates. No securities within our portfolio were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2015 . There were no sales of securities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 no securities were classified as trading securities.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2015 , $23.0 million of our mortgage-related securities were pledged to secure our various obligations including outstanding advances or unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB and interest rate swap contracts.\\n\\n43\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThe table below sets forth information regarding the amortized cost and fair values of our investments and mortgage-related securities at the dates indicated.\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAmortized cost\\n\\nFair value\\n\\nAmortized cost\\n\\nFair value\\n\\nAmortized cost\\n\\nFair value\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nAvailable-for-sale:\\n\\nU.S. Government agency obligations - government-sponsored enterprises\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,047\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,017\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,046\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,965\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,380\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,244\\n\\nMunicipal obligations\\n\\n4,278\\n\\n4,283\\n\\n573\\n\\n578\\n\\n16,207\\n\\n15,489\\n\\nAsset-backed securities\\n\\n1,327\\n\\n1,269\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,514\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,510\\n\\n1,517\\n\\n1,494\\n\\nCollateralized mortgage obligations - government issued\\n\\n43,845\\n\\n44,543\\n\\n67,740\\n\\n68,874\\n\\n111,010\\n\\n111,969\\n\\nCollateralized mortgage obligations - government-sponsored enterprises\\n\\n82,707\\n\\n82,436\\n\\n64,763\\n\\n64,771\\n\\n35,561\\n\\n34,922\\n\\n$\\n\\n140,204\\n\\n$\\n\\n140,548\\n\\n$\\n\\n143,636\\n\\n$\\n\\n144,698\\n\\n$\\n\\n180,675\\n\\n$\\n\\n180,118\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAmortized cost\\n\\nFair value\\n\\nAmortized cost\\n\\nFair value\\n\\nAmortized cost\\n\\nFair value\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nHeld-to-maturity:\\n\\nU.S. Government agency obligations - government-sponsored enterprises\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,495\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,485\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,490\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,473\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nMunicipal obligations\\n\\n16,038\\n\\n16,365\\n\\n16,088\\n\\n16,155\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nCollateralized mortgage obligations - government issued\\n\\n11,718\\n\\n11,709\\n\\n14,505\\n\\n14,531\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nCollateralized mortgage obligations - government-sponsored enterprises\\n\\n8,031\\n\\n7,999\\n\\n9,480\\n\\n9,535\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n37,282\\n\\n$\\n\\n37,558\\n\\n$\\n\\n41,563\\n\\n$\\n\\n41,694\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nU.S. Government agency obligations - government-sponsored enterprises represent securities issued by the FHLMC and FNMA.

The Banks utilize, from time to time, derivative instruments in the course of their asset/liability management. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Banks did not hold any derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. The derivative portfolio consists of interest rate swaps offered directly to qualified commercial borrowers which allowed the Banks to provide a fixed rate alternative to their clients while mitigating interest rate risk by keeping a variable rate loan in their portfolios. The Banks economically hedge client derivative transactions by entering into equal and offsetting interest rate swap contracts executed with dealer counterparties. The economic hedge with the dealer counterparties allows the Banks to primarily offset the fixed rate interest rate risk. Derivative transactions executed through this program are not designated as accounting hedge relationships and are marked to market through earnings each period.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 , the aggregate amortizing notional value of interest rate swaps with various commercial borrowers was approximately 24.7 million . We receive fixed rates and pay floating rates based upon LIBOR on the swaps with commercial borrowers. These swaps mature between March 2016 and February 2023 . Commercial borrower swaps are completed independently with each borrower and are not subject to master netting arrangements. All of these commercial borrower swaps were reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a derivative asset of $552,000 , included in accrued interest receivable and other assets as of December 31, 2015 . On the offsetting swap contracts with dealer counterparties, we pay fixed rates and receive floating rates based upon LIBOR. These interest rate swaps also have maturity dates between March 2016 and February 2023 .  Dealer counterparty swaps are subject to master netting agreements among the contracts within each of our Banks and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a derivative liability of $552,000 . The value of these swaps was included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 .\\n\\nLoans and Leases Receivable\\n\\nLoans and leases receivable, including loans held for sale and net of allowance for loan and lease losses, increased by $150.9 million , or 11.9% , to $1.417 billion at December 31, 2015 from $1.266 billion at December 31, 2014 primarily due to\\n\\n45\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nsuccessful business development efforts in our commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios. As a result, the overall mix of our portfolio remained fairly consistent in 2015 when compared to 2014 . As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , approximately 63.1% and 63.3% of our loan and lease portfolio, respectively, was concentrated in CRE loans primarily in our owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied classes. We were successful in growing both our CRE and C&I portfolios in both our Kansas City and Wisconsin markets. Our CRE portfolio increased by $93.7 million , or 11.5% , to $905.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $811.8 million at December 31, 2014 . Our C&I portfolio increased $56.9 million , or 13.7% , to $473.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $416.7 million at December 31, 2014 . We continue to emphasize actively pursuing C&I loans as this segment of our loan and lease portfolio provides an attractive yield commensurate with an appropriate level of credit risk and creates opportunities for in-market deposit and trust and investment relationships which generate additional fee revenue. While we continue to experience significant competition as banks operating in our primary geographic area attempt to deploy excess liquidity, we remain committed to our underwriting standards and will not deviate from those standards for the sole purpose of growing our loan and lease portfolio. We expect our new loan and lease activity to be more than adequate to replace normal amortization and to continue to grow in future quarters.\\n\\nCredit underwriting through a committee process is a key component of our operating philosophy. Business development officers have relatively low individual lending authority limits, and thus a significant portion of our new credit extensions require approval from a loan approval committee regardless of the type of loan or lease, amount of the credit, or the related complexities of each proposal. In addition, we make every effort to ensure that there is appropriate collateral or a government guarantee at the time of origination to protect our interest in the related loan or lease. To monitor the ongoing credit quality of our loans and leases each credit is evaluated for proper risk rating using a nine grade risk rating system at the time of origination, subsequent renewal, evaluation of updated financial information from our borrowers, or as other circumstances dictate.\\n\\nThe following table presents information concerning the composition of the Banks' consolidated loans and leases, including loans held for sale, at the dates indicated.\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2011\\n\\n(Dollars in Thousands)\\n\\nAmount Outstanding\\n\\n% of Total Loans and Leases\\n\\nAmount Outstanding\\n\\n% of Total Loans and Leases\\n\\nAmount Outstanding\\n\\n% of Total Loans and Leases\\n\\nAmount Outstanding\\n\\n% of Total Loans and Leases\\n\\nAmount Outstanding\\n\\n% of Total Loans and Leases\\n\\nCommercial real estate loans:\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2014 owner occupied\\n\\n$\\n\\n176,322\\n\\n12.3\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n163,884\\n\\n12.8\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n141,164\\n\\n14.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n144,988\\n\\n15.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n150,528\\n\\n17.7\\n\\n%\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2014 non-owner occupied\\n\\n436,901\\n\\n30.4\\n\\n417,962\\n\\n32.5\\n\\n341,695\\n\\n34.8\\n\\n323,660\\n\\n35.5\\n\\n304,597\\n\\n35.8\\n\\nConstruction and land development\\n\\n160,404\\n\\n11.2\\n\\n121,160\\n\\n9.5\\n\\n68,708\\n\\n7.0\\n\\n64,966\\n\\n7.1\\n\\n38,124\\n\\n4.5\\n\\nMulti-family\\n\\n80,254\\n\\n5.6\\n\\n72,578\\n\\n5.7\\n\\n62,758\\n\\n6.4\\n\\n58,454\\n\\n6.4\\n\\n43,905\\n\\n5.2\\n\\n1-4 family\\n\\n51,607\\n\\n3.6\\n\\n36,182\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n30,786\\n\\n3.1\\n\\n31,943\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n43,513\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nTotal commercial real estate loans\\n\\n905,488\\n\\n63.1\\n\\n811,766\\n\\n63.3\\n\\n645,111\\n\\n65.7\\n\\n624,011\\n\\n68.4\\n\\n580,667\\n\\n68.2\\n\\nCommercial and industrial loans\\n\\n473,592\\n\\n33.0\\n\\n416,654\\n\\n32.5\\n\\n293,552\\n\\n29.9\\n\\n256,458\\n\\n28.1\\n\\n237,099\\n\\n27.8\\n\\nDirect financing leases, net\\n\\n31,093\\n\\n2.2\\n\\n34,165\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n26,065\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n15,926\\n\\n1.7\\n\\n17,128\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nConsumer and other:\\n\\nHome equity loans and second mortgage loans\\n\\n8,237\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n7,866\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n5,272\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n4,642\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n4,970\\n\\n0.6\\n\\nOther\\n\\n16,319\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n11,341\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n11,972\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n11,671\\n\\n1.3\\n\\n11,682\\n\\n1.4\\n\\nTotal consumer and other\\n\\n24,556\\n\\n1.7\\n\\n19,207\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n17,244\\n\\n1.8\\n\\n16,313\\n\\n1.8\\n\\n16,652\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nTotal gross loans and lease receivables\\n\\n1,434,729\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,281,792\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n981,972\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n912,708\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n851,546\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n%\\n\\nLess:\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\\n\\n16,316\\n\\n14,329\\n\\n13,901\\n\\n15,400\\n\\n14,155\\n\\nDeferred loan fees\\n\\n1,062\\n\\n1,025\\n\\n1,021\\n\\n748\\n\\n704\\n\\nLoans and lease receivables, net\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,417,351\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,266,438\\n\\n$\\n\\n967,050\\n\\n$\\n\\n896,560\\n\\n$\\n\\n836,687\\n\\n46\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThe following table shows the scheduled contractual maturities of the Banks' consolidated gross loans and leases, including loans held for sale, as well as the dollar amount of such loans and leases which are scheduled to mature after one year which have fixed or adjustable interest rates, as of December 31, 2015 .\\n\\nAmounts Due\\n\\nInterest Terms On Amounts Due\\n\\nafter One Year\\n\\nIn One Year\\n\\nor Less\\n\\nAfter One\\n\\nYear  through\\n\\nFive Years\\n\\nAfter Five\\n\\nYears\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nFixed Rate\\n\\nVariable Rate\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nCommercial real estate\\n\\nOwner-occupied\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,535\\n\\n$\\n\\n112,653\\n\\n$\\n\\n50,134\\n\\n$\\n\\n176,322\\n\\n$\\n\\n107,878\\n\\n$\\n\\n54,910\\n\\nNon-owner occupied\\n\\n70,820\\n\\n257,446\\n\\n108,635\\n\\n436,901\\n\\n294,699\\n\\n71,381\\n\\nConstruction and land development\\n\\n65,925\\n\\n63,518\\n\\n30,961\\n\\n160,404\\n\\n29,167\\n\\n65,311\\n\\nMulti-family\\n\\n15,745\\n\\n46,158\\n\\n18,351\\n\\n80,254\\n\\n48,643\\n\\n15,865\\n\\n1-4 family\\n\\n16,544\\n\\n26,724\\n\\n8,339\\n\\n51,607\\n\\n31,744\\n\\n3,320\\n\\nCommercial and industrial\\n\\n150,938\\n\\n256,936\\n\\n65,718\\n\\n473,592\\n\\n103,895\\n\\n218,760\\n\\nDirect financing leases\\n\\n1,591\\n\\n24,837\\n\\n4,665\\n\\n31,093\\n\\n29,502\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nConsumer and other\\n\\n11,127\\n\\n11,390\\n\\n2,039\\n\\n24,556\\n\\n9,674\\n\\n3,755\\n\\n$\\n\\n346,225\\n\\n$\\n\\n799,662\\n\\n$\\n\\n288,842\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,434,729\\n\\n$\\n\\n655,202\\n\\n$\\n\\n433,302\\n\\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. The Banks originate owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which have fixed or adjustable rates and generally terms of up to five years and amortizations of up to twenty-five years on existing commercial real estate and new construction. The Banks also originate loans to construct commercial properties and complete land development projects.\\n\\nThe Banks' construction loans generally have terms of six to 24 months with fixed or adjustable interest rates and fees that are due at the time of origination. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as project inspections warrant. Multi-family loans are primarily secured by apartment buildings and one-to-four family first mortgage loans are generally secured by properties held for investment and primary and secondary residences of our clients.\\n\\nCommercial real estate lending typically involves larger loan principal amounts than that for residential mortgage loans or consumer loans. The repayment of these loans generally is dependent on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Because payments on commercial real estate loans are often dependent on external market conditions impacting the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, repayment of such loans is often more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy, which are outside the borrower's control. In the event that the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan could be negatively impacted. The deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a material increase in our level of nonperforming loans, which would result in a loss of revenue from these loans and could result in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our net income. Additionally, many of these loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of economic conditions. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could impact collateral coverage associated with the commercial real estate segment of our portfolio, possibly leading to increased specific reserves or charge-offs, which would adversely affect profitability.\\n\\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. The Banks' commercial and industrial loan portfolio is comprised of loans for a variety of purposes which principally are secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, machinery and other corporate assets and are advanced within limits prescribed by our loan policy. The majority of such loans are secured and typically backed by personal guarantees of the owners of the borrowing business. Of the $473.6 million of commercial and industrial loans, including asset-based loans, outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , $146.4 million were originated by FBCC, our asset-based lending subsidiary and $12.2 million were originated by FBF, our factored receivable business line. These asset-based loans, including accounts receivable purchased on a full recourse basis, are typically secured by the borrower's accounts receivable and inventory. These loans generally have higher interest rates and non-origination fees collected in lieu of interest and the collateral supporting the credit is closely monitored. Asset-based loans secured by owner-occupied real estate amounted to $16.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and are included in the owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio.\\n\\n47\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nOur commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a per loan basis. Additionally, asset-based borrowers are usually highly leveraged and/or have inconsistent historical earnings. Significant adverse changes in various industries could cause rapid declines in values and collectability associated with those business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to future losses. An increase in specific reserves and charge-offs may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\\n\\nLeases. Direct financing leases initiated through FBEF are originated with a fixed rate and typically a term of seven years or less. It is customary in the leasing industry to provide 100% financing; however, FBEF will, from time-to-time, require a down payment or lease deposit to provide a credit enhancement. All equipment leases must have an additional insured endorsement and a loss payable clause in the interest of FBEF and must carry sufficient physical damage and liability insurance.\\n\\nFBEF leases machinery and equipment to clients under leases which qualify as direct financing leases for financial reporting and as operating leases for income tax purposes. Under the direct financing method of accounting, the minimum lease payments to be received under the lease contract, together with the estimated unguaranteed residual value (approximating 3 to 20% of the cost of the related equipment), are recorded as lease receivables when the lease is signed and the lease property is delivered to the client. The excess of the minimum lease payments and residual values over the cost of the equipment is recorded as unearned lease income. Unearned lease income is recognized over the term of the lease on a basis which results in a level rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Lease payments are recorded when due under the lease contract. Residual value is the estimated fair market value of the equipment on lease at lease termination. In estimating the equipment's fair value, FBEF relies on historical experience by equipment type and manufacturer, published sources of used equipment pricing, internal evaluations and, when available, valuations by independent appraisers, adjusted for known trends.\\n\\nOur commercial leases are typically larger in amount than leases to individual consumers and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on an individual lease basis. Significant adverse changes in various industries could cause rapid declines in values of leased equipment resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to future losses. An increase in specific reserves and charge-offs may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\\n\\nConsumer and Other Loans. The Banks originate a small amount of consumer loans consisting of home equity, second mortgage, credit card and other personal loans for professional and executive clients of the Banks.\\n\\n48\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nAsset Quality\\n\\nNon-performing loans increased $12.5 million , or 127.7% , to $22.3 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $9.8 million at December 31, 2014 .\\n\\nOur total impaired assets consisted of the following as of the dates indicated.\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2011\\n\\n(Dollars In Thousands)\\n\\nNon-accrual loans and leases\\n\\nCommercial real estate:\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2013 owner occupied\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,907\\n\\n$\\n\\n500\\n\\n$\\n\\n339\\n\\n$\\n\\n769\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,972\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2013 non-owner occupied\\n\\n1,678\\n\\n286\\n\\n283\\n\\n2,871\\n\\n2,249\\n\\nConstruction and land development\\n\\n4,729\\n\\n4,932\\n\\n5,422\\n\\n4,946\\n\\n7,229\\n\\nMulti-family\\n\\n2\\n\\n17\\n\\n31\\n\\n46\\n\\n2,009\\n\\n1-4 family\\n\\n2,611\\n\\n690\\n\\n521\\n\\n1,006\\n\\n3,506\\n\\nTotal non-accrual commercial real estate\\n\\n11,927\\n\\n6,425\\n\\n6,596\\n\\n9,638\\n\\n17,965\\n\\nCommercial and industrial\\n\\n9,136\\n\\n2,318\\n\\n8,011\\n\\n2,842\\n\\n1,558\\n\\nDirect financing leases, net\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n18\\n\\nOther:\\n\\nHome equity and second mortgage\\n\\n542\\n\\n329\\n\\n453\\n\\n612\\n\\n1,002\\n\\nOther\\n\\n655\\n\\n720\\n\\n795\\n\\n1,030\\n\\n1,223\\n\\nTotal non-accrual other loans\\n\\n1,197\\n\\n1,049\\n\\n1,248\\n\\n1,642\\n\\n2,225\\n\\nTotal non-accrual loans and leases\\n\\n22,298\\n\\n9,792\\n\\n15,855\\n\\n14,122\\n\\n21,766\\n\\nForeclosed properties, net\\n\\n1,677\\n\\n1,693\\n\\n333\\n\\n1,574\\n\\n2,236\\n\\nTotal non-performing assets\\n\\n23,975\\n\\n11,485\\n\\n16,188\\n\\n15,696\\n\\n24,002\\n\\nPerforming troubled debt restructurings\\n\\n1,735\\n\\n2,003\\n\\n371\\n\\n1,105\\n\\n111\\n\\nTotal impaired assets\\n\\n$\\n\\n25,710\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,488\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,559\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,801\\n\\n$\\n\\n24,113\\n\\nTotal non-accrual loans and leases to gross loans and leases\\n\\n1.55\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.76\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.61\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.55\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.56\\n\\n%\\n\\nTotal non-performing assets to gross loans and leases plus foreclosed properties, net\\n\\n1.67\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.89\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.65\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.72\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.81\\n\\n%\\n\\nTotal non-performing assets to total assets\\n\\n1.34\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.70\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.28\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.28\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.04\\n\\n%\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses to gross loans and leases\\n\\n1.14\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.12\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.42\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.69\\n\\n%\\n\\n1.66\\n\\n%\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses to non-accrual loans and leases\\n\\n73.17\\n\\n%\\n\\n146.33\\n\\n%\\n\\n87.68\\n\\n%\\n\\n109.05\\n\\n%\\n\\n65.03\\n\\n%\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , $16.2 million and $7.4 million of the non-accrual loans were considered troubled debt restructurings, respectively.  As noted in the table above, non-performing assets consisted of non-accrual loans and leases and foreclosed properties totaling $24.0 million , or 1.34% of total assets, as of December 31, 2015 , an increase in non-performing assets of 108.8% , or $12.5 million , from December 31, 2014 . Impaired loans and leases as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 also included $1.7 million and $2.0 million of loans that are performing troubled debt restructurings which are considered impaired, due to the concession in terms, but are meeting the restructured payment terms and therefore are not on non-accrual status.\\n\\n49\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nA summary of the 2015 non-accrual loan and lease activity is as follows:\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nNon-accrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2014\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,792\\n\\nLoans and leases transferred into non-accrual status\\n\\n18,039\\n\\nAccretion of the fair value discount on purchased credit impaired loans\\n\\n51\\n\\nNon-accrual loans and leases transferred to foreclosed properties\\n\\n(341\\n\\n)\\n\\nNon-accrual loans and leases partially or fully charged-off\\n\\n(1,513\\n\\n)\\n\\nCash received and applied to principal of non-accrual loans and leases\\n\\n(3,730\\n\\n)\\n\\nNon-accrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2015\\n\\n$\\n\\n22,298\\n\\nWe use a wide variety of available metrics to assess the overall asset quality of the portfolio and no one metric is used independently to make a final conclusion as to the asset quality of the portfolio. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 1.34% at December 31, 2015 from 0.70% at December 31, 2014 . This is primarily due to downgrading one $6.2 million restructured relationship to non-performing. This relationship, which was previously reported as impaired in the second and third quarters of 2015, is directly related to the energy sector. This increase was partially offset by cash collections on previously identified impaired loans. Total non-performing assets to total loans and leases and foreclosed properties as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were 1.67% and 0.89% , respectively. We believe the increase in non-performing assets, excluding our energy exposure, is not systemic in nature or indicative of a trend but rather due to downgrading a small number of unrelated credits.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 , our direct exposure to the energy sector consisted of $10.0 million in loans and leases, or 0.70% of total gross loans and leases, with no remaining unfunded commitments. These loans are likely to be adversely affected by a continued severe and prolonged downturn in oil and gas prices. The associated reserve for loan and lease losses related to this portfolio was 6.63% at year end. Of this population, $7.8 million was considered non-performing as of year end. In January 2016, $1.8 million of the total non-performing energy exposure was paid off in full.\\n\\nWe also monitor early stage delinquencies to provide insight into potential future problems. As of December 31, 2015 , the payment performance did not point to any new areas of concern, as approximately 99.6% of the total loan and lease portfolio was in a current payment status. This metric can change rapidly however, if factors unknown to us change. We also monitor our asset quality through our established categories as defined in Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Despite the overall dollar amount and percentage increase in non-performing loans in 2015 compared to 2014, we continue to see positive trends with improving percentages of loans and leases in our higher quality loan categories which is indicative of overall credit quality improvement. While we believe overall asset quality remains strong, we will continue to actively monitor the credit quality of our loan and lease portfolios. Through this monitoring effort, we may identify additional loans and leases for which the borrowers or lessees are having difficulties making the required principal and interest payments based upon factors including, but not limited to, the inability to sell the underlying collateral, inadequate cash flow from the operations of the underlying businesses, liquidation events, or bankruptcy filings and therefore, we expect to continue to experience additions to non-accrual loans. We are proactively working with our impaired loan borrowers to find meaningful solutions to difficult situations that are in the best interests of the Banks.\\n\\nIn 2015 , as well as in the previous five fiscal years, there were no loans over 90 days past due and still accruing interest. Loans and leases greater than 90 days past due are considered impaired and are placed on non-accrual status. Cash received while a loan or a lease is on non-accrual status is generally applied solely against the outstanding principal.  If collectability of the contractual principal and interest is not in doubt, payments received may be applied to both interest due on a cash basis and principal.\\n\\n50\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nAdditional information about impaired loans as of and for the years indicated was as follows:\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2011\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nImpaired loans and leases with no impairment reserves\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,175\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,270\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,200\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,006\\n\\n$\\n\\n18,888\\n\\nImpaired loans and leases with impairment reserves required\\n\\n8,858\\n\\n525\\n\\n8,026\\n\\n4,221\\n\\n2,989\\n\\nTotal impaired loans and leases\\n\\n24,033\\n\\n11,795\\n\\n16,226\\n\\n15,227\\n\\n21,877\\n\\nLess:\\n\\nImpairment reserve (included in allowance for loan and lease losses)\\n\\n1,113\\n\\n290\\n\\n402\\n\\n1,517\\n\\n888\\n\\nNet impaired loans and leases\\n\\n$\\n\\n22,920\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,505\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,824\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,710\\n\\n$\\n\\n20,989\\n\\nAverage impaired loans and leases\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,443\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,474\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,084\\n\\n$\\n\\n17,945\\n\\n$\\n\\n33,793\\n\\nFor the years ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2011\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nInterest income attributable to impaired loans and leases\\n\\n$\\n\\n750\\n\\n$\\n\\n870\\n\\n$\\n\\n887\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,432\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,682\\n\\nLess:  Interest income recognized on impaired loans and leases\\n\\n87\\n\\n740\\n\\n221\\n\\n321\\n\\n787\\n\\nNet foregone interest income on impaired loans and leases\\n\\n$\\n\\n663\\n\\n$\\n\\n130\\n\\n$\\n\\n666\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,111\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,895\\n\\nLoans with no specific reserves required represent impaired loans where the collateral, based upon current information, is deemed to be sufficient or that have been partially charged-off to reflect our net realizable value of the loan. When analyzing the adequacy of collateral, we obtain external appraisals as appropriate. Our policy regarding commercial real estate appraisals requires the utilization of appraisers from our approved list, the performance of independent reviews to monitor the quality of such appraisals and receipt of new appraisals for impaired loans at least annually, or more frequently as circumstances warrant. We make adjustments to the appraisals for appropriate selling costs. In addition, the ordering of appraisals and review of the appraisals are performed by individuals who are independent of the business development process. Based on the specific evaluation of the collateral of each impaired loan, we believe the reserve for impaired loans was appropriate at December 31, 2015 . However, we cannot provide assurance that the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual impaired loan will not change and that the specific reserve or current carrying value will not be different in the future which may require additional charge-offs or specific reserves to be recorded. Smaller balance (individually less than $50,000) loans are collectively evaluated for impairment as allowed under applicable accounting standards.\\n\\nForeclosed properties are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If, at the time of foreclosure, the fair value less cost to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan, the difference, if any, is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property. The fair value is based on appraisals, discounted cash flow analysis (the majority of which is based on current occupancy and lease rates) or verifiable offers to purchase. After foreclosure, valuation allowances or future write-downs to net realizable value are charged directly to non-interest expense. Foreclosed properties were $1.7 million as of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 . We recorded impairment losses of approximately $36,000 , $4,000 and $59,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Net gains on sales of existing foreclosed property inventory were $207,000 , $14,000 and $176,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We continue to evaluate possible exit strategies on our impaired loans when foreclosure action may be probable and our level of foreclosed assets may increase in the future. Loans are transferred to foreclosed properties when we claim ownership rights to the properties.\\n\\n51\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nA summary of foreclosed properties activity for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is as follows:\\n\\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nBalance at the beginning of the period\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,693\\n\\n$\\n\\n333\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,574\\n\\nForeclosed properties acquired in acquisition, at fair value\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n1,605\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nTransfer of loans to foreclosed properties, at lower of cost or fair value\\n\\n341\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n1,381\\n\\nImpairment adjustments\\n\\n(36\\n\\n)\\n\\n(4\\n\\n)\\n\\n(59\\n\\n)\\n\\nNet book value of properties sold\\n\\n(321\\n\\n)\\n\\n(241\\n\\n)\\n\\n(2,563\\n\\n)\\n\\nBalance at the end of the period\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,677\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,693\\n\\n$\\n\\n333\\n\\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\\n\\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of gross loans and leases was 1.14% as of December 31, 2015 and 1.12% as of December 31, 2014 . Non-accrual loans and leases as a percentage of gross loans and leases increased to 1.55% at December 31, 2015 compared to 0.76% at December 31, 2014 . This increase is primarily due to downgrading one $6.2 million restructured relationship to non-performing during the fourth quarter of 2015, which was previously reported as impaired in the second and third quarters of 2015 and is directly related to the energy sector. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded net charge-offs on impaired loans and leases of approximately $1.4 million , which included $1.5 million of charge-offs and $114,000 of recoveries. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we recorded net charge-offs on impaired loans and leases of approximately $808,000 , which included $1.2 million of charge-offs and $425,000 of recoveries.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , our allowance for loan and lease losses to total non-accrual loans and leases was 73.17% and 146.33% , respectively. Impaired loans and leases exhibit weaknesses that inhibit repayment in compliance with the original terms of the note or lease. However, the measurement of impairment on loans and leases may not always result in a specific reserve included in the allowance for loan and lease losses. As part of the underwriting process, as well as our ongoing monitoring efforts, we try to ensure that we have appropriate collateral to protect our interest in the related loan or lease. As a result of this practice, a significant portion of our outstanding balance of non-performing loans or leases either does not require additional specific reserves or requires only a minimal amount of required specific reserve, as we believe the loans and leases are adequately collateralized as of the measurement period. In addition, management is proactive in recording charge-offs to bring loans to their net realizable value in situations where it is determined with certainty that we will not recover the entire amount of our principal. This practice may lead to a lower allowance for loan and lease loss to non-accrual loans and leases ratio as compared to our peers or industry expectations. As asset quality remains strong, our allowance for loan and lease loss is measured more through general characteristics, including historical loss experience, of our portfolio rather than through specific identification and we therefore expect to see this ratio continue to rise. Conversely, if we identify further impaired loans, this ratio could fall if the impaired loans are adequately collateralized and therefore require no specific or general reserve. Given our business practices and evaluation of our existing loan and lease portfolio, we believe this coverage ratio is appropriate for the probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2015 .\\n\\nThe methodology used to determine the level and composition of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was generally comparable. First, we evaluate loans and leases for potential impairment classification. We analyze each loan and lease identified as impaired on an individual basis to determine a specific reserve based upon the estimated value of the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans, or alternatively, the present value of expected cash flows. For each segment of loans and leases that has not been individually evaluated, management segregates the Banks' loss factors into a quantitative general reserve component based on historical loss rates throughout the defined look back period. During 2015, based on the results of our continuous risk assessment and monitoring process, we lengthened the look back period from three years to eight years. This methodology enhancement was implemented to more accurately reflect the estimate of incurred losses for the collectively evaluated loans as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses methodology considers an estimate of the historical loss emergence period (which is the period of time between the event that triggers the loss to the charge off of that loss). During 2015, this methodology was enhanced by estimating the loss emergence period using a more granular approach of analyzing each component of the loss emergence period. The collective impact of these enhancements was not significant. The methodology also focuses on evaluation of several qualitative factors for each portfolio category, including but not limited to: management's ongoing review and grading of the loan and lease portfolios, consideration of delinquency experience, changes in the size of the loan and lease portfolios, existing economic\\n\\n52\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nconditions, level of loans and leases subject to more frequent review by management, changes in underlying collateral, concentrations of loans to specific industries and other qualitative factors that could affect credit losses.\\n\\nWhen it is determined that we will not receive our entire contractual principal or the loss is confirmed, we record a charge against the allowance for loan and lease loss reserve to bring the loan or lease to its net realizable value. When estimated proceeds from the sales of property securing collateral dependent loans are deemed insufficient to repay the related debt, we confirm our inability to receive our entire contractual principal. Many of the impaired loans as of December 31, 2015 are collateral dependent. It is typically part of our process to obtain appraisals on impaired loans and leases that are primarily secured by real estate or equipment at least annually, or more frequently as circumstances warrant. As we have completed new appraisals and/or market evaluations, we have found that in general real estate values have improved; however, in specific situations current fair values collateralizing certain impaired loans were inadequate to support the entire amount of the outstanding debt. Foreclosure actions may have been initiated on certain of these commercial real estate and other mortgage loans.\\n\\nAs a result of our review process, we have concluded that an appropriate allowance for loan and lease loss reserve for the existing loan and lease portfolio was $16.3 million , or 1.14% of gross loans and leases, at December 31, 2015 . Taking into consideration net charge-offs of $1.4 million , the required provision for loan and lease losses was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . However, given ongoing complexities with current workout situations and the measured pace of improvement in economic conditions, further charge-offs and increased provisions for loan and lease losses may be recorded if additional facts and circumstances lead us to a different conclusion. In addition, various federal and state regulatory agencies review the allowance for loan and lease losses. These agencies could require certain loan and lease balances to be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\\n\\n53\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nA summary of the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses follows:\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2011\\n\\n(Dollars In Thousands)\\n\\nAllowance at beginning of period\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,329\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,901\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,400\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,155\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,271\\n\\nCharge-offs:\\n\\nCommercial real estate\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2014 owner occupied\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n(113\\n\\n)\\n\\n(1,376\\n\\n)\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2014 non-owner occupied\\n\\n(653\\n\\n)\\n\\n(631\\n\\n)\\n\\n(792\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n(1,612\\n\\n)\\n\\nConstruction and land development\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n(71\\n\\n)\\n\\n(47\\n\\n)\\n\\n(2,091\\n\\n)\\n\\nMulti-family\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n(130\\n\\n)\\n\\n(312\\n\\n)\\n\\n1-4 family\\n\\n(120\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n(33\\n\\n)\\n\\n(322\\n\\n)\\n\\n(942\\n\\n)\\n\\nCommercial and industrial\\n\\n(701\\n\\n)\\n\\n(600\\n\\n)\\n\\n(14\\n\\n)\\n\\n(2,739\\n\\n)\\n\\n(475\\n\\n)\\n\\nDirect financing leases\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nConsumer and other\\n\\nHome equity and second mortgage\\n\\n(32\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n(72\\n\\n)\\n\\n(113\\n\\n)\\n\\nOther\\n\\n(7\\n\\n)\\n\\n(2\\n\\n)\\n\\n(4\\n\\n)\\n\\n(56\\n\\n)\\n\\n(309\\n\\n)\\n\\nTotal charge-offs\\n\\n(1,513\\n\\n)\\n\\n(1,233\\n\\n)\\n\\n(914\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3,479\\n\\n)\\n\\n(7,230\\n\\n)\\n\\nRecoveries:\\n\\nCommercial real estate\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2014 owner occupied\\n\\n2\\n\\n8\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nCommercial real estate \\u2014 non-owner occupied\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n5\\n\\n61\\n\\n192\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nConstruction and land development\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n281\\n\\n101\\n\\n13\\n\\nMulti-family\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n289\\n\\n1-4 family\\n\\n32\\n\\n17\\n\\n10\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nCommercial and industrial\\n\\n5\\n\\n369\\n\\n11\\n\\n66\\n\\n473\\n\\nDirect financing leases\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n19\\n\\nConsumer and other\\n\\nHome equity and second mortgage\\n\\n4\\n\\n12\\n\\n5\\n\\n11\\n\\n68\\n\\nOther\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n29\\n\\n2\\n\\nTotal recoveries\\n\\n114\\n\\n425\\n\\n374\\n\\n481\\n\\n864\\n\\nNet charge-offs\\n\\n(1,399\\n\\n)\\n\\n(808\\n\\n)\\n\\n(540\\n\\n)\\n\\n(2,998\\n\\n)\\n\\n(6,366\\n\\n)\\n\\nProvision for loan and lease losses\\n\\n3,386\\n\\n1,236\\n\\n(959\\n\\n)\\n\\n4,243\\n\\n4,250\\n\\nAllowance at end of period\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,316\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,329\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,901\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,400\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,155\\n\\nNet charge-offs as a % of average gross loans and leases\\n\\n0.10\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.08\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.06\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.35\\n\\n%\\n\\n0.74\\n\\n%\\n\\nWe review our methodology and periodically adjust allocation percentages of allowance by segment, as reflected in the following table, based upon historical results.

We adhere to high underwriting standards in order to maintain strong asset quality and continue to pursue practical and legal methods of collection, repossession and disposal of any such troubled assets.\\n\\nDeposits\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 , deposits increased by $139.0 million to $1.577 billion from $1.438 billion at December 31, 2014 . The increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in the level of in-market deposits, specifically transaction accounts, which increased by $88.6 million to $397.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $308.5 million at December 31, 2014 . The remainder of the increase from the prior year end was principally due to the increase in wholesale deposits as we continue to strategically use brokered certificates of deposit to mitigate interest rate risk when funding long-term fixed rate loans.\\n\\nDeposit ending balances associated with in-market relationships will fluctuate based upon maturity of time deposits, client demands for the use of their cash, our ability to service and maintain client relationships and new client deposit relationships. Deposits continue to be the primary source of the Banks' fundings for lending and other investment activities. A variety of accounts are designed to attract both short- and long-term deposits. These accounts include non-interest-bearing transaction accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Deposit terms offered by the Banks vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, the rates and products offered by competitors and the interest rates charged on other sources of funds, among other factors. With three separately chartered banks within our Corporation, we have the ability to offer our clients additional FDIC insurance coverage by maintaining separate deposits with each Bank.\\n\\nOur strategic efforts continue to be focused on adding in-market relationships, specifically transaction deposit accounts. We measure the success of in-market deposit gathering efforts based on the number and average balances of our deposit accounts as compared to ending balances due to the volatility of some of our larger relationships. Our Banks' in-market deposits are obtained primarily from the South Central, Northeastern and Southeastern regions of Wisconsin and the greater Kansas City area. Of our total average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately $1.047 billion , or 69.9% , were considered in-market deposits. This compares to average in-market deposits of $791.8 million , or 65.5% , for 2014 . The increase in average in-market deposits is principally due to a full year's contribution from Alterra. Refer to Note 8 - Deposits in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our deposit composition.\\n\\nOur operating range of ending wholesale deposits to ending total deposits is 30%-40%. At December 31, 2015 , the ratio of wholesale deposits to total deposits was 30.9% . We will continue to use wholesale deposits in specific maturity periods needed, typically three to five years, to effectively mitigate the interest rate risk measured through our asset/liability management process and to support asset growth initiatives while taking into consideration our operating goals and desired level of usage of wholesale deposits.

This compares to a total investment of $6.9 million , gross loans and leases outstanding of $57.6 million and net income of $364,000 at and for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\nRimrock Road Investment Fund, LLC . Rimrock, formerly known as FBB Real Estate, LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBB and was originally formed in 2009 for the purpose of holding and liquidating real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or other legal proceedings. In 2014, Rimrock's purpose was changed to reflect its qualified equity investment in a Madison, Wisconsin community development project, including the financing and ownership of a property that generates federal new market tax credits. FBB's total investment in Rimrock at December 31, 2015 was $2.8 million and Rimrock had net income of $249,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 . This compares to a total investment of $2.6 million and a net income of $375,000 at and for the year ended December 31, 2014 .\\n\\nFBB-Milwaukee Real Estate, LLC. FBBMRE is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBB \\u2013 Milwaukee and was formed in 2009 for the purpose of holding and liquidating real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or other legal proceedings. FBB-Milwaukee's total investment in FBBMRE was $10,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and FBBMRE had no income or loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .\\n\\nBOC Investment, LLC. BOC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBB and was formed in 2015 for the purpose of reflecting its equity investment in a Madison, Wisconsin historic development project. The investment provides federal historic\\n\\n57\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\ntax credits upon the completion of the restoration project. At December 31, 2015 , the net carrying value of the investment was $578,000 .\\n\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n\\nWe expect to meet our liquidity needs through existing cash on hand, established cash flow sources, our third party senior line of credit and dividends received from the Banks. While the Banks are subject to certain regulatory limitations regarding their ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, we do not believe that the Corporation will be adversely affected by these dividend limitations. The Corporation's principal liquidity requirements at December 31, 2015 were the interest payments due on subordinated and junior subordinated notes. During 2015 and 2014 , FBB declared and paid dividends totaling $7.0 million and $8.0 million , respectively. The capital ratios of the Corporation and its subsidiaries met all applicable regulatory capital adequacy requirements in effect on December 31, 2015 , and continue to meet the heightened requirements imposed by Basel III, including the capital conservation buffer that went into effect January 1, 2016. The Corporation's and the Banks' respective Boards of Directors and management teams adhere to the appropriate regulatory guidelines on decisions which affect their capital positions, including but not limited to, decisions relating to the payment of dividends and increasing indebtedness.\\n\\nThe Banks maintain liquidity by obtaining funds from several sources. The Banks' primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage-related securities, deposits and other borrowings, such as federal funds and FHLB advances. The scheduled payments of loans and mortgage-related securities are generally a predictable source of funds. Deposit flows and loan prepayments, however, are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.\\n\\nWe view on-balance-sheet liquidity as a critical element to maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our cash and collateral obligations. We define our on-balance-sheet liquidity as the total of our short-term investments, our unencumbered securities available-for-sale and our unencumbered pledged loans. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , our immediate on-balance-sheet liquidity was $331.5 million and $290.8 million , respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Banks had $84.9 million and $70.5 million on deposit with the FRB, respectively. Any excess funds not used for loan funding or satisfying other cash obligations were maintained as part of our on-balance-sheet liquidity in our interest-bearing accounts with the FRB, as we value the safety and soundness provided by the FRB. We plan to utilize excess liquidity to fund loan and lease portfolio growth, pay down maturing debt, allow run off of maturing wholesale certificates of deposit, or invest in securities to maintain adequate liquidity at an improved margin.\\n\\nWe had $487.5 million of outstanding wholesale deposits at December 31, 2015 , compared to $427.3 million of wholesale deposits as of December 31, 2014 , which represented 30.9% and 29.7% , respectively, of ending balance total deposits. We are committed to our continued efforts to raise in-market deposits while maintaining our overall target mix of wholesale deposits and in-market deposits. Wholesale deposits continue to be an efficient source of funding for the Banks and allow them to gather funds across a larger geographic base at price levels and maturities that are more attractive than local time deposits when required to raise a similar level of in-market deposits within a short time period. Access to such deposits allows us the flexibility to refrain from pursuing single service deposit relationships in markets that have experienced unfavorable pricing levels. In addition, the administrative costs associated with wholesale deposits are considerably lower than those that would be incurred to administer a similar level of local deposits with a similar maturity structure. During the time frames necessary to accumulate wholesale deposits in an orderly manner, we will use FHLB short-term advances to meet our temporary funding needs. The FHLB short-term advances will typically have terms of one week to one month to cover the overall expected funding demands.\\n\\nOur in-market relationships remain stable; however, deposit balances associated with those relationships will fluctuate. We expect to establish new client relationships and continue marketing efforts aimed at increasing the balances in existing clients' deposit accounts. Nonetheless, we will continue to use wholesale deposits in specific maturity periods, typically three to five years, needed to effectively mitigate the interest rate risk measured through our asset/liability management process or in shorter time periods if in-market deposit balances decline. In order to provide for ongoing liquidity and funding, all of our wholesale deposits are certificates of deposit which do not allow for withdrawal at the option of the depositor before the stated maturity with the exception of deposits accumulated through the internet listing service which have the same early withdrawal privileges and fees as do our other in-market deposits. The Banks limit the percentage of wholesale deposits to total deposits in accordance with liquidity policies approved by their respective Boards of Directors. The Corporation's overall operating range of wholesale deposits to total deposits is 30%-40%. The Banks were in compliance with their respective policy limits as of December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 .\\n\\nThe Banks were able to access the wholesale deposit market as needed at rates and terms comparable to market standards during the year ended December 31, 2015 . In the event that there is a disruption in the availability of wholesale\\n\\n58\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\ndeposits at maturity, the Banks have managed the maturity structure, in compliance with our approved liquidity policy, so at least one year of maturities could be funded through on-balance-sheet liquidity. These potential funding sources include deposits maintained at the FRB and borrowings from the FHLB or Federal Reserve Discount Window utilizing currently unencumbered securities and acceptable loans as collateral. As of December 31, 2015 , the available liquidity was in excess of the stated policy minimum. As on-balance-sheet liquidity is utilized to fund growth, asset quality remains stable and the ratio of in-market deposits to total deposits remains within an acceptable range, management may consider reducing the number of months of maturity coverage slightly while remaining confident in its ability to manage the maturities of wholesale deposits in the event of a disruption in the wholesale market. We believe the Banks will also have access to the unused federal funds lines, cash flows from borrower repayments and cash flows from security maturities. The Banks also have the ability to raise local market deposits by offering attractive rates to generate the level required to fulfill their liquidity needs.\\n\\nThe Banks are required by federal regulation to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. We believe that the Banks have sufficient liquidity to match the balance of net withdrawable deposits and short-term borrowings in light of present economic conditions and deposit flows.\\n\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 , operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of $23.2 million .  Operating cash flows included net income of $16.5 million . Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $149.6 million which consisted of cash outflows to fund net loan growth and reinvestment of cash flows within purchases of additional securities available-for-sale offset by cash inflows from maturities, redemptions and paydowns of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $136.7 million primarily from net increases in deposits and the use of our unsecured senior line of credit for general operations and other temporary cash flow mismatches, partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders.\\n\\nRefer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity and Regulatory Capital for a summary of the Corporation's and the Banks' capital ratios and the ratios required by their federal regulators at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .\\n\\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 , the Banks had outstanding commitments to originate $512.6 million of loans and commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of clients pursuant to standby letters of credit of $18.6 million . As of December 31, 2015 , the Banks had $251.8 million of commitments to extend funds which extend beyond one year. We do not expect any losses as a result of these funding commitments. We have evaluated outstanding commitments associated with loans that were identified as impaired loans and concluded that there are no additional losses required to be recorded with these unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2015 . We believe that additional commitments will not be granted or additional collateral will be provided to support any additional funds advanced. The Banks also utilize interest rate swaps for the purposes of interest rate risk management, as described further in Note 17 \\u2013 Derivative Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nAdditionally the Corporation has remaining commitments of $960,000 to Aldine Capital Fund, LP (\\\"Aldine\\\") and $2.8 million to Aldine Capital Fund II, LP (\\\"Aldine II\\\"), which are private equity mezzanine funding limited partnerships in which we have invested. Aldine began its operations in October 2006 and Aldine II began its operations in March 2013.\\n\\nWe believe adequate capital and liquidity are available from various sources to fund projected commitments.\\n\\n59\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nContractual Obligations\\n\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2015 :\\n\\nPayments Due by Period\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nLess than  1\\n\\nYear\\n\\n1-3 Years\\n\\n4-5 Years\\n\\nMore than  5\\n\\nYears\\n\\n(In Thousands)\\n\\nOperating lease obligations\\n\\n$\\n\\n10,944\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,227\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,119\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,080\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,518\\n\\nTime deposits\\n\\n567,469\\n\\n190,305\\n\\n190,183\\n\\n147,357\\n\\n39,624\\n\\nLine of credit\\n\\n2,510\\n\\n2,510\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nSubordinated notes\\n\\n22,926\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n22,926\\n\\nJunior subordinated notes\\n\\n10,315\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n10,315\\n\\nFHLB advances and other borrowings\\n\\n8,197\\n\\n4,500\\n\\n3,697\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nTotal contractual obligations\\n\\n$\\n\\n622,361\\n\\n$\\n\\n198,542\\n\\n$\\n\\n195,999\\n\\n$\\n\\n149,437\\n\\n$\\n\\n78,383\\n\\n2014 Compared to 2013\\n\\nTop Line Revenue\\n\\nIn 2014, top line revenue increased by approximately 11.2% from the prior year due in part to two months' contribution from Alterra.\\n\\nReturn on Average Assets and Return on Average Equity\\n\\nROAA was 1.04% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 1.10% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in ROAA was primarily due to relatively stable net income with a larger average asset base. Net income increased 2.9% year over year, primarily due to improved net interest income and non-interest income, which reflects record trust and investment services fee income.\\n\\nROAE for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 11.78% compared to 13.12% for the year ended December 31, 2013. ROAE decreased as a result of relatively stable net income with a larger average equity base primarily as a result of the acquisition of Alterra, in which we paid a combination of $13.5 million in cash and 720,162 shares of our common stock on a post-split basis, which added $16.6 million to our equity.\\n\\nNet Interest Income\\n\\nNet interest income increased by $4.0 million, or 9.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in net interest income during the year was primarily attributable to favorable volume variances from commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate and other mortgage loans and direct financing leases, although it was partially offset by an unfavorable rate variance on the loan and lease portfolio. The yield on average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 4.45% compared to 4.52% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline in the yield on average earning assets was principally due to the overall decline in the yield on the loan and lease portfolio which declined 19 basis points to 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 5.37% for the year ended December 31, 2013. A significant portion of the commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans with terms generally up to five years. As these loans reached their maturity in 2014 and 2013 they were renewed at current market rates, which were generally lower than the original rate of the loan, and subject to competitive pricing pressures. As a result, the overall yield on the commercial real estate portfolio continued to decline in 2014. The marketplace for commercial and industrial loans continued to be subject to competitive pricing pressures, contributing to the decline in yield on this portfolio. Increased prepayment activity and the associated fees collected in lieu of interest partially offset the decline in yields on the loan and lease portfolio. The average balance of the short-term investment portfolio was $67.3 million with a yield of 0.44% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $59.7 million with a yield of 0.42% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\\n\\nThe overall weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 11 basis points from 1.18% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in the overall rate on the interest-bearing liabilities was primarily caused by the replacement of certain maturing certificates of deposit, principally wholesale certificates of deposit, at lower current market rates partially offset by unfavorable volume-related variances in wholesale certificates of deposits and money market deposits. The continued low rate environment combined with the maturity\\n\\n60\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nstructure of our wholesale certificates of deposit provided us the opportunity to be able to manage our liability structure in both maturity terms and rate to deliver an enhanced net interest margin during 2014 relative to 2013. Further, our continued success of attracting in-market non-interest bearing demand deposits through new business relationships and increased client deposit balances contributed to the overall decline in our cost of funds. Average in-market client deposits - comprised of all transaction accounts, money market accounts, and non-wholesale deposits - increased 11.2% to $791.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $712.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\\n\\nNet interest margin increased 2 basis points to 3.56% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 3.54% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\\n\\nNon-Interest Income\\n\\nNon-interest income, consisting primarily of fees earned for trust and investment services, service charges on deposits, loan fee income, gain on sale of loans and leases and income from bank-owned life insurance, increased by $1.7 million, or 19.7%, to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, from $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\\n\\nTrust and investment services fee income increased by $678,000, or 18.1%, to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, our trust assets under management were $773.2 million, or 1.2% more than the trust assets under management of $763.9 million at December 31, 2013, while our assets under administration declined approximately 4.4%, to $186.5 million at December 31, 2014 from $195.1 million at December 31, 2013. During 2014 we underwent a strategic plan to change the mix of our business. We exited lower margin business and added more relationships at wider margins, which was a major contributor to the 18.1% increase in revenue year over year.\\n\\nLoan fees increased by approximately $282,000, or 21.8%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in loan fees was primarily attributable to fees earned for issuing letters of credit on behalf of our clients.\\n\\nGain on sale of loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $392,000, an increase of $392,000 from the year ended December 31, 2013, which was attributable to the gain on sale of the guaranteed portion of originated SBA loans, a new source of non-interest income resulting from the acquisition of Alterra.\\n\\nOther non-interest income decreased by $27,000, or 6.8%, to $369,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $396,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a non-recurring item recorded in 2013 relating to fees earned upon early termination of interest rate swaps with various clients.\\n\\nNon-Interest Expense\\n\\nNon-interest expense increased by $3.4 million, or 11.2%, to $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $30.4 million for the comparable period of 2013, primarily due to an increase in compensation and professional fees, partially offset by a decrease in other expenses due to a $1.3 million contribution in 2013 to the First Business Charitable Foundation (the \\\"Foundation\\\").\\n\\nCompensation expense increased by $3.2 million, or 17.5%, to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to two months' contribution from Alterra, annual merit increases and new staff hired in support of strategic initiatives. The number of full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 215 and 145, respectively. The increase was the result of new employees gained from the acquisition of Alterra.\\n\\nProfessional fees expense increased by $1.4 million, or 73.0%, to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in professional fees was primarily due to specifically identified costs totaling $990,000 related to the acquisition of Alterra.\\n\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized a net gain on foreclosed properties of $10,000 and $117,000 respectively.\\n\\nOther non-interest expense decreased by $2.2 million, or 48.2%, to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4.7 million for the same time period of 2013. The decrease in other non-interest expense was primarily due to a one-time endowment to the Foundation in the amount of $1.3 million in 2013.\\n\\n61\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nIncome tax expense was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The overall decrease in tax expense is primarily due to usage of federal new market tax credits, partially offset by an increased level of pre-tax income in comparison to the prior year. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 33.4% compared to 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested in a federal new market tax credit that  reduced our tax expense by $375,000. We did not utilize any federal new market tax credits in 2013.\\n\\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect the financial position or results of operations for FBFS. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Discussed below are certain policies that are critical to FBFS. We view critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements.\\n\\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents our recognition of the risks of extending credit and our evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio and as such, requires the use of judgment as well as other systematic objective and quantitative methods which may include additional assumptions and estimates. The risks of extending credit and the accuracy of our evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio are neither static nor mutually exclusive and could result in a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We may over-estimate the quality of the loan and lease portfolio resulting in a lower allowance for loan and lease losses than necessary, overstating net income and equity. Conversely, we may under-estimate the quality of the loan and lease portfolio, resulting in a higher allowance for loan and lease losses than necessary, understating net income and equity. The allowance for loan and lease losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses, increased by the provision for loan and lease losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. We estimate the allowance reserve balance required and the related provision for loan and lease losses based on monthly evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, with particular attention paid to loans and leases that have been specifically identified as needing additional management analysis because of the potential for further problems. During these evaluations, consideration is also given to such factors as the level and composition of impaired and other non-performing loans and leases, historical loss experience, results of examinations by regulatory agencies, independent loan and lease reviews, our estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral taking into consideration various valuation techniques and qualitative adjustments to inputs to those estimates of fair value, the strength and availability of guarantees, concentration of credits and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or leases, but the entire allowance is available for any loan or lease that, in our judgment, should be charged off. Loan and lease losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the uncollectability of a loan or lease balance is confirmed. See Note 1 \\u2013 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the allowance for loan and lease losses.\\n\\nWe also continue to exercise our legal rights and remedies as appropriate in the collection and disposal of non-performing assets, and adhere to rigorous underwriting standards in our origination process in order to continue to maintain strong asset quality. Although we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses was appropriate as of December 31, 2015 based upon the evaluation of loan and lease delinquencies, non-performing assets, charge-off trends, economic conditions and other factors, there can be no assurance that future adjustments to the allowance will not be necessary. If the quality of loans or leases deteriorates, then the allowance for loan and lease losses would generally be expected to increase relative to total loans and leases. If loan or lease quality improves, then the allowance would generally be expected to decrease relative to total loans and leases.\\n\\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment. Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Corporation conducted its most recent annual impairment test in July 2015, utilizing a qualitative assessment. See Note 1 \\u2013 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the Corporation's accounting policy on goodwill and see Note 6 \\u2013 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, for a detailed discussion of the factors considered by management in the qualitative assessment. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the 2015 annual qualitative impairment assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill) for the reporting unit. Therefore, a step one quantitative analysis was not required. There were no events since the July 2015 impairment testing that have changed the Corporation's impairment assessment conclusion.\\n\\n62\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIncome Taxes. FBFS and its wholly owned subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, a combined Wisconsin state tax return and a Kansas state tax return. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analysis of many factors, including the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, the difference between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), estimates of amounts currently due or owed, such as the timing of reversals of temporary differences, and current accounting standards. We apply a more likely than not approach to each of our tax positions when determining the amount of tax benefit to record in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We have made our best estimate of valuation allowances utilizing positive and negative evidence and evaluation of sources of taxable income including tax planning strategies and expected reversals of timing differences to determine if valuation allowances were needed for deferred tax assets. Realization of deferred tax assets over time is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable earnings in future periods and a valuation allowance may be necessary if management determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred asset will not be utilized. These estimates and assumptions are subject to change. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could adversely affect future consolidated results of operations. The Corporation believes the tax assets and liabilities are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements. See also Note 16 \\u2013 Income Taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nThe federal and state taxing authorities who make assessments based on their determination of tax laws may periodically review our interpretation of federal and state income tax laws. Tax liabilities could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities based on the completion of examinations by taxing authorities.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
